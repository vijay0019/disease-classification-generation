Train Texts: ['Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare disorder that occurs in some individuals with reduced kidney function, who have been exposed to an intravenous contrast material that contains gadolinium. A contrast material is a dye that is sometimes used during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The term, fibrosis, refers to the thickening and scarring of connective tissue, most often the consequence of inflammation or injury. NSF is characterized by thickening and hardening (fibrosis) of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and, sometimes, underlying skeletal muscle. The arms and legs are most often affected. In some cases, the skin on the trunk can also become involved. This proliferation of fibrotic tissue may become systemic, extending to other areas including the smooth, delicate membrane that surrounds the lungs (pleura), the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), the thin sheet of muscle that aids respiration by moving up and down when breathing (diaphragm), and the outermost layer (dura mater) of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnostic criteria for NSF have been recently developed. A diagnosis of NSF is usually made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical examination and identification of characteristic findings. Surgical removal and microscopic study of a small sample of affected skin tissue (skin biopsy) is required to verify the diagnosis. Additional tests may be performed to exclude several other disorders that can resemble NSF.\n', 'Keratosis follicularis affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 36,000 to 100,000 individuals in the general population. The disorder usually becomes apparent during the second decade in life, but has developed in individuals as young 4 and older than 70. Keratosis follicularis was first described in the medical literature in 1889. A diagnosis of keratosis follicularis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue. A biopsy may reveal abnormal formation of keratin tissue (keratinization) and failure of cell-to-cell adhesion (acantholysis).\n', 'Meleda disease is an extremely rare inherited skin disorder characterized by the slowly progressive development of dry, thick patches of skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). Affected skin may be unusually red (erythema) and become abnormally thick and scaly (symmetrical cornification). Affected children may also exhibit various abnormalities of the nails; excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) associated with an unpleasant odor; and/or, in some cases, development of small, firm raised lesions (lichenoid plaques). The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Meleda disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The diagnosis of Meleda disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation that includes a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic physical findings. In most cases, skin abnormalities may be apparent at birth (congenital) or during infancy including characteristic skin abnormalities on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n', 'Vitamin-D deficiency rickets, a disorder that becomes apparent during infancy or childhood, is the result of insufficient amounts of vitamin D in the body. The vitamin deficiency may be caused by poor nutrition, a lack of exposure to the sun, or malabsorption syndromes in which the intestines do not adequately absorb nutrients from foods. Vitamin D is needed for the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in the body, which, in turn affects how calcium is deposited in the bones; thus it is considered essential for proper bone development and growth. Major symptoms of vitamin D deficiency rickets include bone disease, restlessness, and slow growth. This disorder is rare in the United States but is not uncommon in certain areas of the world.\n', 'Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males. Rarely, females may be affected by the disorder. However, in most cases, females may be carriers of the disease gene, but do not exhibit any symptoms. According to one estimate, the disorder occurs at the rate of approximately one in 380,000 births in the United States.\n', 'Extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a lung disorder resulting from repeated inhalation of organic dust, usually in a specific occupational setting. In the acute form, respiratory symptoms and fever begin several hours after exposure to the dust. The chronic form is characterized by gradual changes in the lung tissue associated with several years of exposure to the irritant. In general, symptoms of all forms of Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis include breathing difficulty, wheezing, and dry coughs that appear to shake the entire body.  Chills, sweating, aching, discomfort and/or fatigue may accompany lung symptoms.  Most cases of this disorder are characterized by mild, short episodes that may be misdiagnosed.  Chronic cases may develop with repeated episodes or prolonged exposure to a specific organic dust. These may involve more severe symptoms including fever, crackling sounds during breathing (rales), breathing difficulty, bluish appearance of the skin (cyanosis), and possibly, expectoration of blood 3. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may affect males and females in equal numbers, but usually affects individuals in occupations in which animal or vegetable dusts are inhaled by people allergic to the substances contained in such dusts. Treatment of extrinsic allergic alveolitis initially depends on identification of the cause of the allergic reaction. If possible, the patient should avoid exposure to the allergen. In an occupational setting, mild cases may be alleviated by improved ventilation or use of air filtering masks. In severe or prolonged cases, however, changing jobs may be the better option. If symptoms persist in spite of avoidance, corticosteroid drugs may be tried. In acute cases, steroids in combination with avoidance measures can often reduce the severity of symptoms. All symptoms can usually be resolved in acute cases if they are diagnosed and treated early before permanent changes in the lungs can develop. If permanent lung changes have occurred at the time of diagnosis, it is possible that the patient may not respond well to treatment.\n', 'Sialadenitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and enlargement of one or more of the salivary glands, the glands that secrete saliva into the mouth. There are both acute and chronic forms. Sialadenitis is often associated with pain, tenderness, redness, and gradual, localized swelling of the affected area. The exact cause of sialadenitis is not known. The exact cause of sialadenitis is unknown.  In some cases, the condition may be associated with the formation of salivary gland stones (sialolithiasis). Sialadenitis affects males and females in equal numbers.  It shows no racial biases. The disorder is often diagnosed by means of a thorough patient history and physical examination. Recent advances in endoscopic equipment make the diagnosis somewhat easier.\n', 'Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction to the use of almost any of a group of antipsychotic drugs or major tranquilizers (neuroleptics). These drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia and other neurological, mental, or emotional disorders. Several of the more commonly prescribed neuroleptics include thioridazine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and perphenazine.\n', 'Portopulmonary hypertension is another vascular complication of liver disease, which is often confused with HPS. However, hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are not the same disease. Although both are abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature resulting from liver disease, HPS is characterized by vasodilatation and hypoxemia whereas portopulmonary hypertension is characterized by obstruction or narrowing (vasoconstriction) of blood vessels with resulting pulmonary arterial hypertension6.\n', 'Moebius syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is present at birth (congenital). The exact incidence and prevalence rates of Moebius syndrome are unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 case per 50,000 live births in the United States. A diagnosis of Moebius syndrome is based upon the characteristic signs/symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. There are no diagnostic tests that confirm a diagnosis of Moebius syndrome. Some specialized tests may be performed to rule out other causes of facial palsy.\n', 'There are seventeen species of birds that are the known carriers of and transmit West Nile Encephalitis (WNE) to humans via the Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes. WNE first causes symptomatic or asymptomatic illness in wild migratory birds that act as viral replication factories. Wild birds infected with WNE contain high titers of the virus and remain viremic for 1-2 weeks, making them ideal hosts to perpetuate the disease. Mosquitoes transmit WNE from birds to humans. Horses, dogs, and other small animals may harbor WNE after being bitten; however, they are inefficient transmitters because viral titers are relatively low, and WNE viremia is short-lived in these animals. In the US the initial cases of WNE were first identified in the greater New York area, but cases have now occurred in western states. Wild birds with WNE virus have also been identified in parts of Canada. WNE is common in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa WNE seropositivity of children in Egypt is approximately 50%. WNE is the most common cause of viral aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in patients presenting to emergency departments in Cairo. Both sexes are affected equally and it is more frequent in elderly patients.\n', 'Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by the triad of hearing loss, degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy) and neurological abnormalities, specifically disease of the nerves outside of the central nervous system (peripheral neuropathy). The arms and legs are most often affected by peripheral neuropathy. Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome is inherited as an X-linked disorder with occasional mild symptoms present in the female carrier. A diagnosis of Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. Molecular genetic testing for PRSP1 gene mutations is available to confirm the diagnosis. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available if a PRSP1 gene mutation has been identified in an affected family member.\n', 'Antisynthetase syndrome is a rare, chronic disorder that can affect multiple systems of the body. The disorder is immune-mediated, which means there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system and the presence of specific autoantibodies that target a specific protein in the body. The symptoms and severity of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. Common symptoms include inflammation of the muscles (myositis), inflammation of several joints (polyarthritis), interstitial lung disease, thickening and cracking of the skin of the hands, and a condition called Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers or toes are numb or have a prickly sensation in response to cold. Affected individuals also have nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, unexplained fevers, and unintended weight loss. The exact, underlying cause is not fully understood. Antisynthetase syndrome sometimes occurs along with other conditions such as uncommon inflammatory muscle diseases like dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Antisynthetase syndrome is a rare disorder that affects females twice as often as males. Age of onset can range from the late teens to the elderly, with a mean average of the 50s. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because rare disorders often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of antisynthetase syndrome in the general population is difficult.\n', "Levy-Yeboa syndrome (LYS) is a recently recognized, inherited (congenital), multi-system disorder involving signs of musculoskeletal involvement such as low muscle tone and stiffening of the joints of the arms and legs (contractions), loss of hearing (neuronal deafness), intense burn-like eruptions of the skin containing clear fluid (bullous eruptions) and dangerous gastrointestinal distress involving substantial loss of fluids (secretory diarrhea), among other issues. Most, if not all, of these signs are apparent at, or within a few months of, birth. The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture presented in the child's first few weeks or months. A late decrease in fetal movement may be sufficient to raise suspicions or concerns regarding Levy-Yeboa syndrome. The combination of major symptoms, myopathy, deafness, skin eruptions and recurrent, massive, watery stools is definitive.\n", 'Chromosome 4, Partial Trisomy Distal 4q is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the fourth chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Associated symptoms and findings may vary from case to case. However, common features include growth deficiency; mental retardation; distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, including an unusually small head (microcephaly), malformed ears, and a prominent nasal bridge; and/or defects of the hands and feet. In some cases, additional physical abnormalities may also be present, such as structural defects of the heart that are present at birth (congenital heart defects); genital abnormalities in affected males; urinary tract defects; and/or other findings. In most cases, the trisomy appears to result from a balanced chromosomal rearrangement in one of the parents; rarely, it is thought to arise from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). In observed cases, Chromosome 4, Partial Trisomy Distal 4q has appeared to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 60 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Fountain syndrome is an extremely rare genetic multisystem disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability; abnormal swelling of the cheeks and lips due to the excessive accumulation of body fluids under the skin (subcutaneous) of the face (edema); skeletal abnormalities; and/or deafness due to malformation of a structure (cochlea) within the inner ear. The exact underlying cause of Fountain syndrome is unknown. The disorder is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Fountain syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is believed to affect males and females in equal numbers. Only several cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of Fountain syndrome in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Rubella is a viral infection characterized by fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, aching joints, and a distinctive red rash. Although it is sometimes called German measles or three-day measles, it is not caused by the same virus that causes measles. Rubella is generally mild in children and more severe but not life-threatening in adults. However, if a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, it can cause serious problems for the unborn child. In the United States, most children receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and therefore the disease has become uncommon. In March 2005, health officials announced that rubella has been eliminated from the United States. However, it is still important for Americans to vaccinate their children, and women who are pregnant or might get pregnant still need to be sure they are immune, because the disease exists elsewhere. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nine rubella cases were reported in the United States in 2004, and all of them originated in other countries. Rubella affects males and females in equal numbers.  During 1964 and 1965, according to the CDC, a rubella epidemic in the United States caused an estimated 12.5 million cases of rubella and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome, which led to more than 11,600 babies born deaf, 11,250 fetal deaths, 2,100 neonatal deaths, 3,580 babies born blind, and 1,800 babies born mentally retarded.  Since 1969, the rubella virus has been included in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine routinely given to babies and young children. Since the rubella rash is so much like rashes caused by other viruses, the definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of blood tests for the presence of the virus.\n', 'The symptoms of CCAL2 usually begin as acute, recurring attacks of pain, swelling warmth and redness in one or more joints. Other affected people have swelling, stiffness, and pain with little or no inflammation. in the joints A knee, wrist, hip, or shoulder is most frequently affected, although any joint of the body may be involved. Acute episodes can last for days to weeks, and symptoms may subside without treatment. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposits may accumulate around the bones of the spine (vertebrae) and cause back or neck pain and/or loss of mobility. Many patients with CPDD develop chronic arthritis which can resemble osteoarthritis. CCAL2 is a rare disorder. Eight families have been described in the medical literature.  Some studies indicate a greater prevalence of non-genetic CPDD in females, but this is based on weak evidence. There is no known ethnic predilection.\n', 'Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a variable genetic disorder that is characterized by slow growth before and after birth, small head (microcephaly), mild to moderate mental retardation and multiple birth defects including particular facial features, cleft palate, heart defects, fused second and third toes, extra fingers and toes and underdeveloped external genitals in males.  The severity of SLOS varies greatly in affected individuals, even in the same family, and some have normal development and only minor birth defects. SLOS is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that results in an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism.  SLOS is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. For the US the birth prevalence of SLOS has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 live births.  The predicted prevalence based on newborn screening for gene carriers is estimated to be 1 in 1,590 to 13,500 and this discrepancy may be due to the fact that many fetuses with SLOS are stillborn.   This condition occurs equally in males and females but females are often not diagnosed because genital abnormalities are missed.  SLOS occurs more often in individuals of European ancestry. The diagnosis of SLOS is based on physical findings and detection of an elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in blood serum or an elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol:cholesterol ratio. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the DHCR7 gene is available and is mainly used for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.\n', 'Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a term for a specific pattern of damage to the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs in the body, one on each side of the body just below the rib cage in the back. The kidney has multiple functions including filtering the blood of waste products and other substances and producing urine to carrying waste from the body. FSGS occurs when the filters of the kidney, which are made of clusters of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and known as renal glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis). Each kidney has about a million glomeruli, which are part of a larger structure called the nephron; the nephron is the basic unit of the kidneys. The glomeruli help to filter out waste products and extra fluid from the blood. Scarring or damage to the glomeruli can lead to an inability of the kidneys to process waste products and eliminate those waste products from the body through the urine. Ultimately, these abnormalities lead to progressive kidney damage including decreased function and efficiency of the kidneys, and potentially kidney failure. There are different causes of FSGS and, in some instances, the cause is unknown. Depending on the cause, FSGS may be treated with certain medications, but sometimes despite treatment affected individuals will eventually require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n', 'Essential iris atrophy is a very rare, progressive disorder of the eye characterized by a pupil that is out of place and/or distorted areas of degeneration on the iris (atrophy), and/or holes in the iris. This disorder most frequently affects only one eye (unilateral) and develops slowly over time. Attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae) and subsequent closure of the drainage angle may lead to secondary glaucoma and vision loss. Essential iris atrophy is a very rare disorder that predominantly affects females in the middle adult years. The prevalence is not known.\n', 'Kufor Rakeb syndrome is considered an ultra-rare disorder. Fewer than 50 individuals have been reported in the literature. Because KRS is a rare and complex disease, it is possibly underdiagnosed and the real prevalence of the disease is therefore hard to estimate. As it is the case for all autosomal recessive disorders, children of parents who are blood relatives are at an increased risk of developing the disease, as they are more likely to receive the same copy of a disease-causing (pathogenic) mutation from each parent.\n', 'Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common blood vessel disorder in persons over 50 years old that causes inflammation of medium and large-sized arteries in the body (vasculitis). GCA causes changes in blood vessel walls leading to poor blood circulation. Arteries most affected in giant cell arteritis are the temporal artery and other cranial arteries (now called cranial-GCA), but inflammation of the aorta and other large arteries in the body can occur as well and may present differently (now called large vessel-GCA). If left untreated, this can lead to a medical emergency where sudden blindness occurs without early detection and treatment. Signs and symptoms when the temporal or other cranial arteries are involved include arm pain, pulsing headaches on one side or on the back of the head, jaw pain, scalp tenderness, double vision or other visual disturbances, bulging temporal artery that is tender with skin edema and redness. It can also present with constitutional symptoms such as polymyalgia, fevers, anorexia, and weight loss, a presentation of LV-GCA. The cause of giant cell arteritis is still unknown but is thought to be from the immune system causing damage to the body’s own blood vessels. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that is closely related to giant cell arteritis and occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with giant call arteritis. 15% to 20% of persons with polymyalgia rheumatica will have giant cell arteritis. Treatments available include steroids (corticosteroids) that will help with symptoms and reoccurrence and medications that weaken the immune system. Giant cell arteritis most commonly affects those over 50 years old (mostly above 65 years) and is more common in Caucasians, people of Nordic or northern European descent, and others in northern latitudes. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop GCA than men in persons of northern European descent while there is no higher risk for women from Spain, Israel, Turkey, other Mediterranean countries, and India. Specifically, about 20 per 100,000 people among whites in northern European populations are affected, 10 per 100,000 people affected among southern European populations, and about 1 per 100,000 people affected among American populations of Asian or African descent.\n', '"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder in which deficiency of an enzyme (hexosaminidase A) results in excessive accumulation of certain fats (lipids) known as gangliosides in the brain and nerve cells. This abnormal accumulation of gangliosides leads to progressive dysfunction of the central nervous system. This disorder is categorized as a lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are the major digestive units in cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or ""digest"" nutrients, including certain complex carbohydrates and fats. When an enzyme like hexosaminidase A, which are needed to breakdown certain substances like fats, are missing or ineffective, they build up in the lysosomal. This is called abnormal “storage”. When too much fatty material builds up in the lysosome, it becomes toxic destroying the cell and damaging surrounding tissue."\n', 'The most conclusive processes for the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia include a bone marrow aspirate, blood counts, and ELA2 genetic testing. The aspirate follows a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and blood tests (i.e., white blood cell count) that measure the various types of blood cells in the circulation. In individuals with severe chronic neutropenia, such blood counts demonstrate abnormally low levels of neutrophils. Normal counts of neutrophils range between 1.5 and 7 billion cells per liter of blood. If the neutrophil count falls below 0.5, then severe neutropenia is suggested.\n', 'Proctitis is a chronic inflammatory disease arising in the rectum and characterized by bloody diarrhea.  There are two types of proctitis, ulcerative and gonorrheal, which are differentiated by the means in which they are contracted. Gonorrheal proctitis is transmitted through sexual contact. Proctitis is increasing in incidence.  Gonococcal Proctitis is most frequently found in women and homosexual men who practice anal-receptive intercourse. Diagnosis of proctitis is made when sigmoidoscopy reveals inflammation of the mucus lining of the rectum with a clearly demarcated upper border above which the lining is normal. The remainder of the colon and small intestine is found to be normal by barium x-rays, while colonoscopy and rectal biopsy may show changes which are indistinguishable from those of chronic ulcerative colitis. (For more information on chronic ulcerative colitis, see the related disorder section of this report.)\n', 'Homozygous OSMED (oto-spondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by malformation (dysplasia) of certain bones, hearing loss and distinct facial features. Skeletal malformations affect the bones of the arms, legs and spines eventually resulting in disproportionate short stature. Hearing loss is often severe. Intelligence is normal. Homozygous OSMED occurs because of disruptions or changes (mutations) to the COL11A2 gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A diagnosis of homozygous OSMED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including x-rays. X-ray studies reveal characteristic skeletal malformations associated with homozygous OSMED. Genetic testing is also available to scan for mutations of genes coding for collagen XI.\n', 'Campomelic syndrome is a rare congenital disorder in which multiple anomalies are present. It is characterized by bowing and angular shape of the long bones of the legs, especially the tibia; multiple minor anomalies of the face; cleft palate; other skeletal anomalies such as abnormalities of the shoulder and pelvic area and eleven pairs of ribs instead of the usual twelve; underdevelopment of the trachea; developmental delay in some cases and incomplete development of genitalia in males such that they appear to be females. Campomelic syndrome is a rare disorder that is thought to affect females twice as often as males.  These numbers may not be accurate as some patients with this disorder have associated sex reversal and have been mistakenly identified as the opposite sex.  Approximately one hundred cases of this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, x-rays of vertebrae, hips, chest, legs and feet, ultrasound of kidneys and echocardiogram of the heart. DNA analysis of blood can confirm a mutation in the SOX9 gene.\n', 'Harlequin ichthyosis is a rare genetic skin disorder. The newborn infant is covered with plates of thick skin that crack and split apart. The thick plates can pull at and distort facial features and can restrict breathing and eating. Harlequin infants need to be cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit immediately. Harlequin ichthyosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Harlequin ichthyosis affects males and females in equal numbers. This condition affects approximately one in 500,000 persons or about seven births annually in the United States.\n', '3/100,000 people per year are affected by glioblastoma in the United States. The average age of diagnosis is 64 years of age with a slightly higher rate in men than women. Caucasians have the highest rate of glioblastoma diagnoses compared to other ethnic groups such as African-Americans, Asians, and American Indians. It is important to differentiate glioblastoma from other tumors that can affect the brain. These include but are not limited to chordomas, central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas, ependymoma, medulloblastomas, lower grade brain tumors, and other cancers that have spread to the brain from other areas. Other conditions such as stroke, brain abscesses, brain bleeds, and cavernous malformations can be mistaken for glioblastoma and should also be ruled out before a diagnosis is made.\n', 'The exact prevalence and incidence of abetalipoproteinemia is unknown, but it is estimated to affect less than 1 in 1,000,000 people in the general population. Abetalipoproteinemia affects both males and females. There are no known racial or ethnic preferences for the disorder. Abetalipoproteinemia is more prevalent in populations with a high incidence of consanguineous marriages. Symptoms usually become apparent during infancy.\n', "Dupuytren's contracture is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by fixation of the joints (e.g., proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints) of certain fingers in a permanently flexed position (joint contractures). Due to abnormal thickening and shortening of the bands of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the palm (palmar fascia), a hardened nodule may develop, eventually forming an abnormal band of hardened (fibrotic) tissue. As a result, the fingers of the affected area begin to be drawn in toward the palm over several months or years and cannot be pulled back (contracture). In addition, the skin of the affected area may pucker. In most cases, the ring and pinky (fourth and fifth) fingers are most affected. In addition, the disorder usually affects both hands (bilateral). Although the exact cause of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, risk for the disorder appears to be increased by alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis) and the presence or certain other diseases, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. In addition, it is thought that genetic predisposition may be a factor. Dupuytren’s contracture is characterized by a drawing up of the fingers toward the palms of the hand.  The feet are rarely involved.  Loss of function of the fingers and deformities may also occur, including nodular growths on the fingers.  One or both hands may be affected.  The right hand seems to be more frequently involved when involvement is only one sided (unilateral).  The ring finger is involved most often, followed in order by the little, middle and index fingers.  A nodule or plaque may develop as the first symptom on the finger.  Symptoms may develop spontaneously and without any known associated condition.  In other cases liver disease, alcoholism, pulmonary tuberculosis or diabetes mellitus may occur in conjunction with Dupuytren’s contracture. Dupuytren’s contracture is a disease of the fibrous tissue.  Its cause is unknown, but genetic predisposition and the presence of other diseases or medical conditions may be factors.  It appears that one’s risk is increased by certain lifestyle factors, such as alcoholism, and the presence of certain diseases, such as liver disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. The diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation including a comprehensive patient history, observation of characteristic findings, and specialized tests. Histochemical tests and use of an electron microscope may confirm the diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture.\n", 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increased risk of developing a specific form of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid carcinoma) and benign tumors affecting additional glands of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is the network of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. These hormones regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the function of various organs and activities within the body. Hormones are involved in numerous vital processes including regulating heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Glands affected in MEN2 may secrete excessive amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, which can result in a variety of symptoms. MEN2 affects males and females in equal numbers. It has been estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 people in the general population. Some researchers believe that many cases of MEN2 go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. MEN2A is the most common subtype accounting for more than 80 percent of cases. MEN2B is the least common accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases. All cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (i.e., both those are associated with MEN2 and those are not) account for approximately 5-10 percent of thyroid cancers.\n', 'Adie syndrome, or Holmes-Adie syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye. In most patients the pupil is larger than normal (dilated) and slow to react in response to direct light. Absent or poor tendon reflexes are also associated with this disorder. In most individuals, the cause is unknown (idiopathic), but Adie syndrome can occur as due to other conditions such as trauma, surgery, lack of blood flow (ischemia) or infection. In rare cases localized disturbance of sweat secretion is associated with Adie syndrome (Ross syndrome). Adie syndrome involves a usually non progressive and limited damage to the autonomic nervous system, which is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates certain involuntary body functions including the reaction of the pupils to stimuli. Adie syndrome affects females more often than males by a ratio by some estimates of 2.6:1 for cases where the cause is unknown. Young adults usually between the ages of 25 to 45 are most commonly affected. The prevalence of Adie’s pupil (not the full syndrome) is approximately 2 people per 1,000 in the general population. The exact incidence or prevalence of Adie syndrome itself is unknown. In most instances, treatment will not be necessary. Glasses may be prescribed to correct blurred vision; sunglasses can help individuals with sensitivity to light. Therapy using dilute pilocarpine may improve poor depth perception and relieve glare in some patients. The loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent.\n', 'Influenza is a common infectious viral disease with symptoms that may appear similar to inhalational anthrax. However, anthrax does not cause runny nose, which is a typical symptom of the common cold and influenza. Also, patients with anthrax appear to have abnormal X-rays, while those with flu and other viruses do not. Cutaneous anthrax may be diagnosed by the characteristic signs, such as the raised area on the skin and detection of the presence of the anthrax bacilli in the area of the lesion. A history of exposure to livestock or other possible animal sources also is important. Gastrointestinal anthrax is more difficult to diagnose. In the first, mild phase of inhalational anthrax, symptoms resemble a common cold or upper respiratory infection. With the sudden onset of the more severe symptoms of the second phase, radiographic examination of the chest may show characteristic changes.\n', 'Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that is rare in the United States. However, it is not rare in many other countries. Major symptoms may include unusually high fever, headache, loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Typhoid is caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.  It is the most serious of the Salmonella infections.  Contaminated food or water is most often the source of a Typhoid outbreak.  Contact with a carrier of the bacterium, polluted water, infected food or milk, shellfish harvested from polluted water, or fresh vegetables grown in contaminated soil are all sources of the Salmonella Typhi bacterium.  People who have had Typhoid are “carriers” until the bacteria is completely gone from their body.  If they touch food served to other people when their hands are not properly washed, they can spread Typhoid to those who eat the food. Typhoid is treated with the antibiotic drugs chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefoperazone, pefloxacin, co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Precautions to take, especially when visiting countries with unsanitary conditions, includes the practice of good personal hygiene and careful washing of hands. Avoid drinking untreated water, drinks served with ice, unpeeled fruits and vegetables, and other food that is cooked and not served hot. In food preparation; wash and sanitize utensils in hot water; carefully clean cutting boards, work areas and equipment; keep hot foods at 165 F and cold foods at 40 F or colder to avoid the possible growth of bacteria in food. Typhoid vaccination and food precautions are necessary before traveling to developing countries where this kind of disease is prevalent.\n', 'Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs almost exclusively in women. It is characterized by inflammation of the membrane lining the stomach (peritoneum) and the tissues surrounding the liver (perihepatitis). The muscle that separates the stomach and the chest (diaphragm), which plays an essential role in breathing, may also be affected. Common symptoms include severe pain in the upper right area (quadrant) of the abdomen, fever, chills, headaches, and a general feeling of poor health (malaise). Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a general term for infection of the upper genital tract in women. Infection is most often caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. A diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is made through the exclusion of other causes of upper right abdominal pain. A diagnosis may be confirmed with a variety of specialized tests including x-ray examination, diagnostic laparoscopy, and certain laboratory exams. X-ray examination may include ultrasound, chest or stomach radiographs, and computed tomography (CT) scanning. X-rays are used to rule out other possible conditions or reveal characteristic inflammation of the perihepatic region. During a laparoscopy, a small, thing tube is inserted in the abdominal cavity through a small incision in the stomach. A laparoscopic exam allows a physician to view the liver and surrounding tissue. Laboratory exams can identify infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n', 'Adult onset Still’s disease affects men and women in equal numbers. Some reports state that the disorder affects women slightly more often than men. It primarily affects young adults between the ages of 16-35. The incidence of adult onset Still’s disease is unknown. Because of the highly variable symptoms and rarity of the disorder, it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Physical urticaria is a condition in which red (erythematous) allergic skin lesions and itching (pruritus) are produced by exposure to heat, cold, or contact with chemicals or plants. These are called wheals by the medical community and may range in size from a couple of millimeters to a couple of centimeters. The center of the lesion may range in color from white to red, and it is usually surrounded by a flare of red skin. The disorder occurs most commonly in children. The underlying cause of physical urticaria is unknown in most cases. Some clinicians believe that an auto-immunological process is responsible. Cold urticaria occurs most often in infants, although it sometimes occurs in adults. The patient history and physical examination are the tools most often used to diagnose physical urticaria. If there is a history of reactions to physical triggers, the diagnosis may be confirmed with a challenge. The challenge is the application of the suspected agent, for example ice or light, to the skin, in hope of getting a response.\n', 'Anemia of chronic disease, also called the anemia of inflammation, is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Anemia is characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. Anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. In mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness. The underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood. Anemia of chronic disease varies in severity from one person to another. In most cases, anemia is usually mild or moderate. Affected individuals may develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, irritability, chest pain and additional findings. These symptoms may occur in any individual who has a comparable degree of anemia. In most cases, the symptoms associated with the underlying disease usually take precedent over the mild or moderate anemia symptoms. In rare cases, anemia of chronic disease can be severe and cause more serious complications. Anemia of chronic disease affects males and females in equal proportion. Individuals of any age who have a chronic, inflammatory condition can potentially develop the condition. The exact incidence of anemia of chronic disease is unknown and some researchers believe that it is underreported or often goes unrecognized. Anemia of chronic disease is believed to be the second most common cause of anemia in the United States after iron-deficiency anemia. A diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests can measure the levels of certain substances in the body including hemoglobin levels, the levels of iron in the serum, total iron binding capacity, overall red blood cell count, or normal or increased levels of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body’s iron stores in the blood plasma. Another test that may be performed measures transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a protein that is involved in the transport of iron from the intestines into the bloodstream. Methods to allow the reliable measurement of hepcidin in plasma have been developed but are not available or approved for use in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease at present.\n', "Kikuchi's disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenopathy, is a rare, benign, (noncancerous, nonmalignant) disorder of the lymph nodes of young adults, predominantly of young women. This disorder is often mistaken for malignant lymphoma, especially cervical adenopathy because the symptoms are very similar. The lesions, or tissue anomalies, of this disorder cause the lymph nodes to become enlarged (lymphadenopathy), inflamed and painful. The exact cause of Kikuchi's disease is not known. Perhaps the primary threat is a misdiagnosis of a malignant lymphoma. The exact cause of Kikuchi’s disease is not known (idiopathic). Many researchers suspect that a virus may cause this disorder. Others, however, believe that the disorder, like systemic lupus erythematosus, is a self-limited autoimmune condition. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons.\n", 'Björnstad syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the presence of abnormally flattened, twisted hair shafts (pili torti) and, in most cases, deafness (sensorineural hearing loss). Hearing loss typically affects both ears (bilateral). Individuals with this disorder usually have dry, fragile, lusterless, and/or coarse scalp hair as well as areas of patchy hair loss (alopecia). Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been reported in the medical literature. Björnstad syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that was first described in 1965. In theory, it affects males and females in equal numbers. However, in observed cases, more females than males have been identified. More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of Björnstad Syndrome may be suspected by the finding of twisted hair (i.e., pili torti), which may be obvious at birth. The diagnosis is confirmed by examination of hair shafts from affected individuals under an electron microscope, demonstrating characteristic twisting of the hair shafts at regular intervals. Since the presence of this hair abnormality is suggestive of Björnstad Syndrome, all infants with this finding should be evaluated for possible nerve deafness. Sensorineural deafness may be confirmed through a variety of specialized hearing (auditory) tests.\n', 'A prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland (adenoma) that produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. In women, hyperprolactinemia is characterized by irregular menstrual periods or even absence of periods, infertility and production of breast milk in women who are not pregnant (galactorrhea). The most common symptom in men is impotence. The cause of pituitary tumors is unknown. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic and not associated with genetic factors that are inherited or can be passed on to children. Pituitary tumors that produce enough prolactin to affect health occur in approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. All patients who are shown to have a pituitary adenoma on MRI or CT imaging should have a serum prolactin level checked and if their prolactin level is >150-200 ng/ml the patient likely harbors a prolactin secreting tumor which should be treated with a dopamine agonist medication rather than surgery. If the level is less, this could be due to a tumor <10 mm or lack of normal inhibition by hypothalamic dopamine which then permits the normal prolactin secreting cells to hypersecrete (stalk effect). The effect of certain medications, recreational drugs, macroprolactin (big prolactin molecule with no effect on the body), other medical conditions (like low thyroid function, hepatic or renal insufficiency) should be evaluated for these lower levels. A specialist consultation should be considered for such patients by an experienced endocrinologist. Prolactinoma is treated with medications that act like dopamine (dopamine agonists) such as bromocriptine, quinagolide and cabergoline because dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. These medications reduce the size of the tumor and reduce the amount of prolactin secretion in approximately 80-90% of patients. Surgery may be recommended if medical therapy is not effective or bothersome side effects (dizziness, mental fogginess, nausea, vomiting). For both medical therapy and surgery, cure rates depend on the size and location of the tumor and the prolactinoma can recur in some affected individuals. Radiation therapy is sometimes used to control growth of a prolactinoma if no response to medications and not amenable to surgery.\n', 'An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a rare benign (non-cancerous) growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve. This nerve runs from the inner ear to the brain and is responsible for hearing and balance (equilibrium). Although there is no standard or typical pattern of symptom development, hearing loss in one ear (unilateral) is the initial symptom in approximately 90 percent of affected individuals. Additional common findings include ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and dizziness or imbalance. The symptoms of an acoustic neuroma occur from the tumor pressing against the eighth cranial nerve and disrupting its ability to transmit nerve signals to the brain. An acoustic neuroma is not cancerous (malignant); it does not spread to other parts of the body. The reason an acoustic neuroma forms is unknown.\n', "Legionnaires' Disease is recognized as an acute respiratory pneumonia caused by the aerobic gram-negative microorganism, Legionella pneumophila, and other species. This microorganism may also affect other body systems. Afflicted patients may have pulmonary (lung and bronchi), gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system complications. Renal insufficiency may occur occasionally and can be severe enough to require dialysis. The primary symptoms associated with Legionnaires’ Disease appear to be pneumonia including a shaking chill, sharp pain in the involved side of the chest, cough with sputum or phlegm production, fever of up to 105º F, and, in some cases, rapid and painful respiration.  Abdominal pain, diarrhea, neurological signs such as headache, confusion, lethargy or agitation may also be present.  Laboratory data may include an abnormal liver function test, low phosphorus in the blood (hypophosphatemia), blood in the urine (hematuria), and low blood sodium (hyponatremia). Like Legionnaires’ Disease, Pontiac Fever is caused by infection with bacteria belonging to the Legionella family.  Associated symptoms usually include a general feeling of ill health (malaise), fatigue, fever, chills, muscle aches (myalgia), and headache.  Some individuals with Pontiac Fever may also develop nausea, cough, joint aches (arthalgia), diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  The pneumonia seen in Legionnaires’ Disease is not present.  Affected individuals usually recover without treatment (self-limiting illness) in a few days.  In those who develop Pontiac Fever, the time between initial infection and symptom onset (incubation period) is typically about one to two days.  In contrast, the incubation period for Legionnaires’ Disease usually ranges from approximately two to 10 days.\n", 'Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare, but well-known complication of solid organ transplants and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PTLD is related to the Epstein-Barr virus and immunosuppression therapy. People who receive these transplants are treated with drugs that suppress the activity of the immune system. Doctors must suppress the immune system to help the body accept the transplant and avoid rejection. Individuals receive these drugs at the time of the transplant (induction therapy) and must remain on these drugs for the rest of their lives (maintenance therapy). Immunosuppressive therapy leaves patients at a greater risk of developing infections and, in some people, of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of these disorders are extremely important. The incidence and prevalence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease varies based on the type of transplant and affects about 1%-2% of people who have received a kidney (renal) transplant. Rates are higher in heart and lung transplants. PTLD occurs most often with gastrointestinal and multiorgan transplants. PTLD is the most common cancer affecting people who receive solid organ transplants after squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In a retrospective multicenter study, the overall incidence of PTLD in people who had hematopoietic stem-cell transplants was reported to be 3.2%\n', 'As of 2015, this condition is estimated to affect about 2 to 5 per 10,000 newborns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are about 1,871 babies born with gastroschisis in the United States each year. Gastroschisis can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound or upon birth. It is differentiated from omphalocele by the presence of freely floating abdominal organs in the amniotic cavity without a membranous covering. The organs appearing on the outer surface of the abdomen, after delivery, confirms the diagnosis.\n', 'Cysticercosis is a rare infectious disease caused by the presence and accumulation of the larval cysts of a tapeworm (cestode) within tissues of the body. The scientific name for the tapeworm that causes cysticercosis is Taenia solium (T. solium), which is also known as the pork tapeworm. T. solium cysts (cysticerci) may affect any area of the body including the brain, a condition known as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms vary from case to case. If cysticerci are located in the brain, central nervous system abnormalities may occur, most often seizures and headaches. Cysticercosis may also affect the eyes, spinal cord, skin and heart. Cysticercosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Some forms of cysticercosis such as racemose cysticercosis occur more frequently in females. Approximately 1,000 cases of cysticercosis are reported each year in the United States. The disease is more common in Mexico, Latin America, South America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Cysticercosis cases have risen in the United States following increased immigration from endemic areas. Tapeworms can be acquired from various uncooked meats, including beef and fish, but only pork tapeworms appear to produce larvae capable of invading human muscle and forming cysts. A diagnosis of cysticercosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of specialized tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan may be used to diagnose neurocysticercosis.\n', 'Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by abnormalities of the heart’s electrical conduction system, and is characterized on the electrocardiogram (a test that records the electrical activity of the heart) by prolongation of the QT interval that corresponds to prolongation of the recovery phase or repolarization of the heart muscle (ventricular myocardium) after each heartbeat. QT prolongation predisposes those affected to an increased risk of life threatening sudden alterations in the cardiac rhythm, (termed arrhythmias), specifically torsade de pointes (TdP) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias can lead to sudden loss of consciousness (syncope), cardiac arrest and potentially cause sudden cardiac death. The severity of cardiac symptoms varies greatly from one person to another, even among family members who carry the same rare genetic variant. Some individuals may have no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) for their entire lives, whilst others develop arrhythmias resulting in episodes of syncope, and cardiac arrest, at a young age. Several different factors are known to trigger the onset of symptoms including physical activity, excitement and fright, although cardiac events may occur while asleep or at rest. Long QT syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers and has been identified in all ethnic groups. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is not known. It is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 2,000 live births from a clinical and genetic study of 44,500 newborns (neonates).\n', 'In North America and Europe, males are two times more likely to get the disease, while in Asia, females are just as likely as males to be affected.4   In terms of ethnicity, Asians are much more likely then Caucasians who are, in turn, much more likely than black population to get IgA nephropathy. This disease most often presents between teenage years to late 30’s, but can present at any age. 5\n', "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when women are pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. It is a rare disease of the placenta, the organ that joins the mother to her offspring and provides nourishment to the developing fetuses. During the development of identical twins, there are always blood vessels in the fetuses' shared placenta that connect their blood circulations (placental anastomoses). In most cases, the blood flows properly through these vessels. However, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the blood begins to flow unevenly, with one fetal twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and one receiving too little (donor). The recipient twin may experience heart failure due to continual strain on its heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system). The donor twin, on the other hand, may experience life-threatening anemia, insufficient nutrition and oxygen due to its inadequate supply of blood. Such an imbalance in blood flow (i.e., twin-twin transfusion) can occur at any time during the pregnancy, including during delivery. TTTS is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when a mother is pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. There have been a few reported cases in which TTTS also affected identical triplets. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome affects approximately 5 to 15 percent of identical twin pregnancies, meaning that approximately 6,000 babies may be affected each year. However, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of TTTS in the general population since many cases are never diagnosed and many go unrecorded.\n", 'The diagnosis is based on the presence of respiratory distress accompanied by low levels of oxygen in the blood and the presence of known risk factors such as sepsis, pneumonia, or trauma. Chest x-rays will show fluid filling spaces that should be filled with air. The presence of fluid in the air sacs and the “wet” breathing sounds sometimes made by patients may suggest congestive heart failure but a medical examination will often distinguish between that condition and ARDS.\n', 'All types of aniridia affect males and females in equal numbers. This disorder is thought to occur in approximately one in 60,000 to 100,000 live births in the United States.\n', 'Blue diaper syndrome is a rare, genetic metabolic disorder characterized by the incomplete intestinal breakdown of tryptophan, a dietary nutrient. Symptoms typically include digestive disturbances, fever, irritability and visual difficulties. Some children with blue diaper syndrome may also develop kidney disease. Infants with this disorder may have bluish urine-stained diapers. Blue diaper syndrome is inherited as an autosomal or X-linked recessive trait. Blue diaper syndrome is an extremely rare metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. A diagnosis of blue diaper syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and the demonstration of indican in a fresh urine sample (indicanuria).\n', 'Cerebral Palsy is a neurological movement disorder characterized by the lack of muscle control and impairment in the coordination of movements. This disorder is usually a result of injury to the brain during early development in the uterus, at birth, or in the first two years of life. Cerebral Palsy is not progressive. Cerebral Palsy is a relatively rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The United Cerebral Palsy Association estimates that between 1 in 1000 and 3 in 1000 infants develop Cerebral Palsy each year in the United States.  There are approximately 9000 new cases of this disorder reported each year.\n', 'Diastrophic dysplasia, which is also known as disastrophic dwarfism, is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). The range and severity of associated symptoms and physical findings may vary greatly from case to case. However, the disorder is often characterized by short stature and unusually short arms and legs (short-limbed dwarfism); abnormal development of bones (skeletal dysplasia) and joints (joint dysplasia) in many areas of the body; progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis and/or kyphosis); abnormal tissue changes of the outer, visible portions of the ears (pinnae); and/or, in some cases, malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area.\n', 'Valinemia is a very rare metabolic disorder. It is characterized by elevated levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine caused by a deficiency of the enzyme valine transaminase. This enzyme is needed in the breakdown (metabolism) of valine. Infants with valinemia usually have a lack of appetite, vomit frequently, and fail to thrive. Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and hyperactivity also occur. Valinemia is usually present at birth.  Symptoms in the newborn period include protein intolerance, metabolic acidosis, frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, and coma.  The condition may become life-threatening.  The levels of the amino acid valine in the blood and urine are elevated.  Abnormally low muscle tone, excessive drowsiness, and/or hyperactivity can also occur. Valinemia is a rare disorder, occurring once in about 250,000 live births in the United States.  It is present in affected infants at birth. Diagnosis depends on the precise laboratory identification and measurement of metabolic products that accumulate in the blood and urine. Sophisticated chromatographic equipment is required to identify these metabolites.\n', 'Nance-Horan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that may be evident at birth (congenital). It is primarily characterized by abnormalities of the teeth and clouding of the lens of the eyes (congenital cataracts), resulting in poor vision. Additional eye (ocular) abnormalities are also often present, such as unusual smallness of the front, clear portion of the eye through which light passes (microcornea) and involuntary, rapid, rhythmic eye movements (nystagmus). In some affected individuals, the disorder may also be associated with additional physical abnormalities and/or intellectual impairment. The range and severity of symptoms may vary greatly from one person to another, including among affected members of the same family. As discussed above, Nance-Horan syndrome is usually fully expressed in males only, although females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygotes) may develop certain features. The disorder is present at birth (congenital). Nance-Horan syndrome was described in 1974 by two research teams independent of each other. Fewer than 50 families (kindreds) have been described in the medical literature. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Researchers believe that affected individuals may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Nance-Horan syndrome in the general population.\n', 'Tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, and/or skin. TDO syndrome is characterized by kinky or curly hair; poorly developed tooth enamel; and unusual thickness and/or denseness (sclerosis) of the top portion of the skull (calvaria) and/or the long bones (i.e., bones in the arms and legs). In some cases, affected individuals also exhibit abnormally thin, brittle nails or premature closure (fusion) of the fibrous joints between certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the head to appear abnormally long and narrow (dolicocephaly). Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Approximately 12 affected families (kindreds) have been reported in the medical literature.  TDO syndrome is usually apparent between the ages of approximately six months to one year..\n', 'Congenital afibrinogenemia is a very rare disorder that affects approximately one in a million people. Males and females are equally affected. There doesn’t seem to be any ethnic predisposition to this disease [6, 15]. However, as it is an autosomal recessive disorder, children whose parents are blood relatives (consanguineous) are more at risk. Indeed, individuals from the same family are more likely to have the same rare mutation and can have an affected child if he or she inherits the mutation from both parents. Therefore, the disease is more common in areas with high rates of consanguineous marriage, such as the Middle East and Southern India [16].\n', 'Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a rare and complex recessively inherited disorder of immune-cell dysfunction with multiple autoimmunities. It presents as a group of symptoms including potentially life-threatening endocrine gland and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Autoimmune disorders occur when antibodies and immune cells are launched by the body against one or several antigens of its own tissues. APS-1 is caused by changes (mutations) in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. HLA-DR/DQ genes also play a role in predisposing to which of the component autoimmune disease the patient actually develops. APS-I is a very rare disorder that tends to cluster in certain homogenous populations, including certain groups of Finns, Iranian Jews, and Sardinians. However, it can be found in numerous populations and among multiple ethnic groups. In the US, APS-1 probably affects as few as 1 in every 2-3 million newborns.\n', 'Whipple disease is a rare disease resulting from bacterial infection that leads to inadequate absorption of nutrients (malabsorption) from the intestine. It is believed to result from infection with bacteria known as Tropheryma whippelii. The infection usually involves the small intestine, but over time, the disease may affect various parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and eyes. Whipple disease is caused by a rod-shaped bacterium called Tropheryma whippelii.  This bacterium was first identified in 1991/92.  Its natural habitats are unknown, but it appears likely that infection occurs by way of an environmental source and that the bacteria are introduced into the body through the mouth (peroral). Whipple disease affects more males than females in a ratio of approximately 4 to 1.  The symptoms of this disorder typically begin between the ages of thirty and sixty years.  The age range of those affected is thought to be between 30 and 80, with the median age at time of diagnosis being 56 years.  Most of the cases of Whipple disease have been diagnosed among Europeans and  Americans of European parentage.  In Germany, the disease incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million population per year.  A few cases have been reported among American Indians and Americans of African descent. In 2004, for the first time, a case of Whipple disease was reported in Japan. The standard diagnostic approach is to study a tissue sample (biopsy) from the small intestine. Blood testing can determine whether anemia is present. Confirmation of diagnosis can be achieved either by electron microscopy or by a test known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which detects the DNA of T. whippelii.\n', 'Familial eosinophilic cellulitis is a rare skin disorder. It is characterized by raised, red, swollen, and warm areas of skin, in a flame-shaped pattern with associated pain. The exact cause of the disease is unknown. However, bites of spiders, bees, mites, fleas, or ticks (arthropods) are often associated with this skin condition. The exact cause of familial eosinophilic cellulitis is still not known.  Some scientists believe that there may be an autoimmune basis for the disorder.  Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.), against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue. Familial eosinophilic cellulitis affects males and females in equal numbers.  The disorder is more often found in adults, but it may strike children as well. Standard treatment of familial eosinophilic cellulitis may consist of administration of steroid drugs. However, the disorder often resolves itself after a number of weeks. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.\n', 'Primary gastric lymphoma is a general term for a type of cancer that originates within the stomach. Approximately 90 percent of patients of primary gastric lymphoma are either mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) gastric lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the stomach. MALT gastric lymphoma is often associated with infection with the Helicobacter pylori bacterium. Within the medical literature, significant controversy exists regarding the exact definition, classification and staging of primary gastric lymphoma.\n', 'Ogilvie syndrome is believed to affect males and females in equal numbers, although one large study suggested that males may be affected more often than females. Ogilvie syndrome can potentially affect individuals of any age, but most often occurs in late middle age (mean age in the 60s). The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases can go unrecognized and resolve spontaneously, determining the true frequency of the disorder is the general population is difficult. Ogilvie syndrome generally develops in hospitalized or institutionalized individuals following an acute illness or surgery.\n', '"Marshall-Smith Syndrome is characterized by unusually quick physical growth and bone development (maturation), usually starting before birth. Other symptoms can include respiratory difficulties, mental retardation, and certain physical characteristics. (Note: Marshall-Smith Syndrome is not to be confused with ""Marshall"" Syndrome, which is very different from ""Marshall-Smith"" Syndrome.) The exact cause of Marshall-Smith Syndrome is unknown.  There is no evidence that it is genetic. Marshall-Smith Syndrome is a rare disorder present at birth affecting males and females in equal numbers.  Symptoms of the syndrome are usually present before birth (prenatal onset). Treatment of Marshall-Smith Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Aggressive treatment of breathing (respiratory) difficulties is necessary. Special education and related services will be necessary during school years."\n', 'Primary visual agnosia is an extremely rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The first detailed account of visual agnosia in the medical literature occurred in 1890. A variety of psychophysical tests can be conducted to pinpoint the nature of the visual process that is disrupted in an individual. Brain damage that causes visual agnosia may be identified through imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n', 'Yellow Fever is a viral infection that causes damage to the liver, kidney, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Major symptoms may include sudden onset of fever, yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and hemorrhage. It occurs predominately in South America, the Caribbean Islands and Africa. The disease is spread through bites of infected mosquitos. Incidence of the disease tends to increase in the summer as the mosquito population increases, and it occurs year round in tropical climates. Yellow Fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite by an infected mosquito. Initially, a mosquito acquires the disease by ingesting the blood of an infected host.  The mosquito then transmits the infection to its next bite victim. Yellow Fever affects males and females equally. People living in semitropical or tropical climates are at risk unless they are vaccinated against this infection. People in southern areas of the United States, living near marshes and swamps may be at risk during the summer months. However, most cases of Yellow Fever occur in Africa and South America. The treatment of Yellow Fever is symptomatic and supportive. Preventative measures consist of mosquito control and a vaccine that prevents development of the infection. Immunity from a vaccination usually develops after 10 days and lasts for more than 10 years. In some cases, side effects associated with vaccination may occur five to 10 days later. These side effects affect approximately 5 percent of individuals receiving immunization and may include headache, fever, and/or aching muscles.\n', 'Ruvalcaba syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by short stature, abnormalities affecting the head and facial (craniofacial) area, mental retardation, skeletal malformations, and/or underdeveloped (hypoplastic) genitalia. Characteristic craniofacial features include an abnormally small head (microcephaly); an abnormally small, narrow nose; and down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Skeletal malformations may include fifth fingers that are permanently fixed in a bent position (clinodactyly) and/or abnormally short bones between the wrists and the fingers (metacarpals) and the ankles and toes (metatarsals), resulting in unusually small hands and feet. In addition, affected children may have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and/or unusual prominence of the breastbone (pectus carinatum). Ruvalcaba syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Ruvalcaba syndrome is a rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers.  Probably fewer than a dozen confirmed cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Several cases of what were initially  diagnosed as Ruvalcaba syndrome proved to be cases of two related disorders — trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III and Hunter-McAlpine craniosynostosis syndrome.  (For more information on these disorders, see the Related Disorders section below.)  It is highly likely that some cases of Ruvalcaba syndrome may go unrecognized and remain undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. The diagnosis of Ruvalcaba syndrome may be suspected based upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., microcephaly, characteristic facial abnormalities, skeletal malformations, etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and x-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal shortening of bones in the hands and feet (i.e., metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges).\n', 'Tongue cancers are oral cancers that are differentiated by their location in the mouth and on the tongue. If the cancer is on the forward portion of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer of the oral tongue. If the cancer is located towards the rear third of the tongue, it is known as a squamous cell cancer at the base of the tongue. Tongue cancer is most common in men over age 60.  It is rare in people, particularly women, under age 40. Examination of a sample of tissue from the site of the suspected cancer by a qualified pathologist is the key to diagnosis. MRI and/or CAT scans may be ordered to determine the location and size of the growth. This examination will also determine the stage of the disorder (how advanced it may be), which in turn, will help determine the method and pace of treatment.\n', 'Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID) is a type of primary immunodeficiency, which is defined as an immune system dysfunction typically caused by a mutation in a gene or genes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes more than 180 primary immunodeficiencies ranging from relatively common to quite rare. CVID equally affects males and females. The prevalence of CVID is approximately 1 in 30,000 people. The diagnosis of CVID is not made in children under the age of 4, because until that time, it may be confused with other genetic defects that must be excluded. In addition, it can be confused with physiologic immaturity. However, most patients have symptoms later and are not diagnosed until ages 20-40.\n', 'Aicardi syndrome typically begins as involuntary muscle spasms between four months and four years of age. Other symptoms may include epilepsy, intellectual disability, profound muscle weakness (hypotonia), an abnormally small head (microcephaly), abnormally small eyes (microphthalmia), an incomplete development of the retina and nerve in the back of the eye (colobomas), and/or abnormalities of the ribs and/or spinal column. Children of all ages with Aicardi syndrome have significant delay in motor development. Aicardi syndrome can be life-threatening during childhood due to complications from upper respiratory infections. Aicardi syndrome usually affects only females. In very rare cases, males with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) may have Aicardi syndrome. It has been estimated that there are between 300 and 500 cases of Aicardi syndrome worldwide. There do not appear to be any differences based on ethnicity or gender. It is usual to have an MRI of the brain. This study makes pictures of the brain to look for a small or missing corpus callosum and other problems with the formation of the brain. Individuals with Aicardi syndrome should have a test to look at the brain waves (EEG) to diagnose and treat seizures. An ophthalmologist should look into the eyes at the retina. In Aicardi syndrome, this almost always reveals small cream-colored cavities (lucunae) within the retina.\n', 'Biliary atresia is a rare gastrointestinal disorder characterized by destruction or absence of all or a portion of the bile duct that lies outside the liver (extrahepatic bile duct). The bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. Bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. In biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver. Affected infants have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and scarring of the liver (fibrosis). In some cases, additional abnormalities may be present, including heart defects and intestinal, spleen and kidney malformations. The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown. Biliary atresia is a rare disorder with a slight increased frequency in females. It occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 births in the United States. Approximately 400-600 new cases of biliary atresia are encountered in the United States each year. According to one estimate, the prevalence of biliary atresia in Europe is approximately 1 in 12,000 births. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. The diagnosis of biliary atresia requires a direct examination of the bile ducts by abdominal surgery (laparotomy) and the microscopic examination of tissue from the liver (liver biopsy). During the surgery special contrast dye is injected into the gallbladder and x-ray films are taken to outline how the dye fills the major bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiogram). These films show the movement (or lack of movement) of the dye through bile ducts and into the small intestine. The physician/surgeon is then able to evaluate the structure of the bile ducts and to determine the site of the blockage (proximal or distal). Blood tests may demonstrate elevated levels of liver enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin and detect viral agents; high blood levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 has been discovered to be highly specific for biliary atresia. Ultrasound of the liver may show absence of the gall bladder.\n', 'Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is an extremely rare malignant (cancerous) tumor arising from the smooth muscle lining the walls of the large vein that carries blood from the lower body to the heart (inferior vena cava). There are essentially two types of muscles in the body - voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles - the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, the smooth muscle in walls of blood vessels contracts to help regulate blood flow.\n', 'Segawa syndrome affects girls and women more often than boys and men. In sporadic cases (i.e., new mutations), women are affected four times more often than men. Women are also more likely to have severe symptoms than men are. The exact incidence of Segawa syndrome in the general population is unknown. Researchers believe that the disorder is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Segawa syndrome and tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, which is also known as autosomal recessive dopa-responsive dystonia, account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of primary dystonia in childhood. Segawa syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1971. It was originally called hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation.\n', 'Distal myopathy (or distal muscular dystrophy) is a general term for a group of rare progressive genetic disorders characterized by wasting (atrophy) and weakness of the voluntary distal muscles. The distal muscles are those farther from the center of the body and include the muscles of the lower arms and legs and the hands and feet. Conversely, the proximal muscles are the muscles closest to the center of the body such as the muscles of the shoulder, pelvis, and upper arms and legs. Although age of onset can occur anytime from infancy to adulthood, most forms develop later in life and are slowly progressive. Inheritance is autosomal dominant or recessive. Since no distal myopathy has been linked to the X-chromosome, distal myopathies affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of the distal myopathies is unknown. Some forms have been identified with greater frequency in certain populations. Udd distal myopathy occurs with greater frequency in Finland where the prevalence is estimated to be 7 in 100,000 individuals. Welander distal myopathy occurs with greater frequency in Sweden where the prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 1,000 individuals. Approximately 220 cases of IBM2 have been identified in the medical literature. The muscular dystrophies as a whole are estimated to affect 250,000 individuals in the United States.\n', 'CHILD syndrome (an acronym for congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects) is an inherited disorder, affecting primarily women, that is characterized by ichthyosis-like skin abnormalities and limb defects on one side of the body. Other abnormalities may be present, as well. Only about 30 cases have been reported in the United States and of these 29 involved infant girls and only 1 involved a boy.   Of these 30 cases, only 6 cases involved organs or systems on the left side of the body. A thorough physical exam may be sufficient for the diagnosis.\n', "Aniridia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental deficiency, also known as Gillespie syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is characterized by the absence, in whole (aniridia) or in part (partial aniridia), of the colored portion (iris) of the eye; impaired coordination of voluntary movements due to underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the brain's cerebellum (cerebellar ataxia); and mental retardation. The condition usually affects both eyes (bilateral) but a few cases have been reported in which only one eye is affected. Some individuals with this syndrome also exhibit a delay in the acquisition of skills requiring coordination of muscular and mental activity (psychomotor retardation). ACAMD is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait and is extremely rare, with only 20 to 30 cases reported in the medical literature. Aniridia, cerebellar ataxia and mental deficiency is an extremely rare inherited disorder that appears to affect females more than males, although the sample size is very low.  Only about 20 or 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  One report suggests that people with this syndrome make up about 2% of all patients with aniridia.\n", 'Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is an extremely rare, but life-threatening complication that affects pregnant women shortly before, during, or immediately following labor and childbirth. Most instances occur during labor. In this disorder, it is hypothesized that a pregnant woman has a severe, allergic reaction to amniotic fluid or other fetal material such as fetal cells, which enter the mother’s bloodstream. Amniotic fluid is contained within the amniotic sac. This fluid supports, cushions, and protects a developing fetus. Amniotic fluid embolism is unpredictable and no risk factors have been identified.  AFE can cause a severe, rapid decline in the mother’s health. For years, some researchers believed that the amniotic fluid and fetal cells cause obstruction within the mother’s blood vessels, but now most researchers believe that the mother’s immune system reacts to the amniotic fluid and fetal cells causing an overwhelming immune system response, which ends up harming the mother and the fetus. Breathing problems, cardiac arrest, and excessive bleeding are some of the life-threatening complications that can occur. Researchers and physicians do not fully understand why amniotic fluid or fetal cells entering the mother’s bloodstream causes this reaction in some women. Amniotic fluid embolism is a medical emergency that develops suddenly and rapidly and can be fatal. Early recognition and prompt supportive treatment are essential. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare complication that occurs just before, during, or immediately after birth. The number of women who have experienced this complication is unknown.  Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare disorder. Rare disorders often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Estimates have ranged from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 80,000 pregnancies.\n', 'Tooth agenesis is a condition in which teeth are missing. Anodontia is a genetic disorder defined as the absence of all teeth. It usually occurs as part of a syndrome that includes other abnormalities.  Also rare but more common than anodontia are hypodontia and oligodontia. Hypodontia is genetic in origin and usually involves the absence of from 1 to 5 teeth. Oligodontia is genetic as well and is the term used to describe a condition in which six or more teeth are missing. The prevalence of anodontia is unknown. This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of hypodontia is 2 to 8% of the general population (excluding third molar) and oligodontia is 0.09%. to 0.3%.\n', 'The exact incidence and prevalence of Dent disease is unknown. Dent disease type 1 has been reported in approximately 250 families. Dent disease type 2 has been reported in approximately 25 individuals. Because some affected individuals go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining these disorders’ true frequency in the general population is difficult. Dent disease is fully expressed in males only. Dent disease may be recognized during childhood, while other cases can remain undiagnosed well into adulthood.\n', 'Approximately 60% of MCC tumors arise in men. In the past 15 years, the incidence has tripled in the United States, and it can be lethal for about one-third of the people affected. As of 2015, approximately 2,500 persons per year are diagnosed with this cancer in the United States. The incidence (number of people who develop a disorder over a given period of time such as one year) is approximately 0.7 people per 100,000 people in the general population of the United States. It dramatically increases to approximately to 9.8 people per 100,000 in individuals more than 85 years of age. There is a 100,000-fold difference between the risk of developing MCC for patients under the age of 30 compared to those who are greater than 85 years old (Paulson 2018).\n', 'Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact prevalence is unknown; this disorder may be underdiagnosed because it is difficult to detect in patients with mild symptoms. Currently, more than 150 people with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'APL comprises 5 to 10% of all cases of adult acute myeloid leukemia. Each year in the United States, it develops in around 2.2 people per million, for a total of 600 to 800 individuals. Although APL can occur at any age, middle age adults are most commonly affected; the median age at diagnosis is around 40. Epidemiological studies have shown that APL is slightly more common in Hispanics and slightly less common in African Americans compared to other ethnic groups. In very rare cases, APL can occur after chemotherapy or radiation therapy for other cancers, especially when therapy involves a class of medication known as topoisomerase II inhibitors; this is called therapy-related APL.\n', "Congenital Varicella Syndrome is an extremely rare disorder in which affected infants have distinctive abnormalities at birth (congenital) due to the mother's infection with chickenpox (maternal varicella zoster) early during pregnancy (i.e., up to 20 weeks gestation). Affected newborns may have a low birth weight and characteristic abnormalities of the skin; the arms, legs, hands, and/or feet (extremities); the brain; the eyes; and/or, in rare cases, other areas of the body. The range and severity of associated symptoms and physical findings may vary greatly from case to case depending upon when maternal varicella zoster infection occurred during fetal development.\n", 'Miller syndrome is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 case per 1 million newborns. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency in the general population is difficult. Fewer than 75 cases have been described in the medical literature. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.\n', 'The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary actions such as widening or narrowing of our blood vessels. Failure in this system can lead to orthostatic hypotension, which means a sudden drastic drop in blood pressure especially from a lying or sitting down position. The exact cause of pure autonomic failure (PAF) is not known, but is defined as autonomic failure without central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) involvement. PAF is caused by abnormal accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in autonomic nerves. This protein helps nerve cells communicate, but its function is not fully understood. Patients with PAF have a loss of nerve cells (neurons) in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. The worldwide prevalence of PAF is not known. The age of onset is during adulthood usually in individuals over 60 years. It is more common in males than in females.\n', 'De Barsy syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence and prevalence of this disorder is unknown. Because cases may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of de Barsy syndrome in the general population is difficult. De Barsy syndrome is usually obvious at birth or early infancy.\n', 'A diagnosis of PNH may be suspected in individuals who have symptoms of intravascular hemolysis (e.g., hemoglobinuria, abnormally high serum LDH concentration) with no known cause. A diagnosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. The main diagnostic test for individuals with suspected PNH is flow cytometry, a blood test that can identify PNH cells (blood cells that are missing GPI-anchored proteins).\n', 'Acanthocheilonemiasis is a rare tropical infectious disease caused by a parasite known as Acanthocheilonema perstans, which belongs to a group of parasitic diseases known as filarial diseases (nematode). This parasite is found, for the most part, in Africa. Symptoms of infection may include red, itchy skin (pruritis), abdominal and chest pain, muscular pain (myalgia), and areas of localized swelling (edema). In addition, the liver and spleen may become abnormally enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). Laboratory testing may also reveal abnormally elevated levels of certain specialized white blood cells (eosinophilia). The parasite is transmitted through the bite of small flies (A. coliroides). Acanthocheilonemiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by long “thread-like” worms, Acanthocheilonema perstans, also known as Dipetalonema perstans. The disease is transmitted by a small black insect (midge), called A. Cailicoides. Acanthocheilonema perstans, the parasite that causes Acanthocheilonemiasis is common in central Africa and in some areas of South America.  This disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. Acanthocheilonemiasis is treated by means of the administration of antifilarial drugs, some of which are newer than others. Ivermectin or diethyl-carbamazine (DEC) are frequently prescribed. Occasionally, surgery may be required to remove large adult worms. Mild cases of acanthocheilonemiasis do not require treatment.\n', 'Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is a rare genetic autoinflammatory disorder. Autoinflammatory syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by seemingly random or unprovoked episodes of inflammation generally due to an abnormality of the innate immune system. They are not the same as autoimmune disorders, in which the adaptive immune system malfunctions and mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Mevalonate kinase deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 300 individuals worldwide are known to have the disorder, but the true number is likely greater. Most people with the disorder are individuals of western European heritage with approximately 60% occurring in Dutch or French individuals. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown and it is likely that the disorder goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. This makes it difficult to determine the exact incidence or prevalence of mevalonate kinase deficiency in the general population.\n', 'PM and NM may appear at any time from infancy through the age of 80 years, but most commonly occurs in adults over 20 years of age, especially those aged 45 to 60 years. Juvenile PM is very rare (much less common than juvenile DM) and the symptoms usually appear between the ages of five to 15 years. Females are affected twice as often as males and PM is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. The diagnosis of PM is often delayed due to the lack of physical findings before the onset of muscle disease. Both family history and medication history are important in excluding other causes of myopathy. Additionally, various tests may be performed to establish a diagnosis. Tests may include: (a) electromyography done by a specialist in neuromuscular diseases which detects characteristic electrical patterns in muscle tissue and are abnormal in almost all patients with polymyositis; (b) muscle biopsy which reveals inflammation and or necrosis in the muscle tissue; (c) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected muscle(s) which demonstrates inflammation and edema within the muscle tissue. Blood tests can be performed to detect elevated levels of muscle enzymes, predominantly creatine kinase (CK) and aldolase among others, which are indicative of muscle damage. Autoantibodies have been identified in many PM and NM patients consistent with an autoimmune cause as discussed earlier.\n', 'Tuberculosis (TB) is an acute or chronic bacterial infection found most commonly in the lungs. The infection is spread like a cold, mainly through airborne droplets breathed into the air by a person infected with TB. The bacteria causes formation of small tissue masses called tubercles.  In the lungs these tubercles produce breathing impairment, coughing and release of sputum. TB may recur after long periods of inactivity (latency) if not treated adequately. Many variations of TB exist and are distinguished by the area of the body affected, degree of severity and affected population. This disease today is considered curable and preventable. It is very rare in the United States but is on an upsurge.\n', 'Fewer than 20 individuals with cerebral folate deficiency have been reported in scientific literature. The exact prevalence of this condition is unknown.\n', 'Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) is a viral infection that rarely causes obvious illness. The virus that causes CMV is part of the herpes virus family and, like other herpes viruses, may become dormant for a period of time and then be reactivated. CMV affects young children mainly, but it is estimated that by age 30 in the United States, half of all adults are, or have been, infected. The virus can pass from an infected, pregnant mother to her child through the shared blood supply (umbilical cord). Cytomegalovirus infection is caused by the human cytomegaloviruses (also known as “salivary gland viruses”). These are a subgroup of infective agents closely related to the herpes group of viruses.  Like other herpes viruses, they may remain latent for years in people. The CMV virus is closely related to the herpes group of viruses.  (For more information on Cytomegalovirus Infection and other herpes viruses, use “CMV” and “Herpes” as your search terms in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', '"Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic is a rare chromosomal disorder in which chromosome 14 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body. The term ""mosaic"" indicates that some cells contain the extra chromosome 14, whereas others have the normal chromosomal pair. In observed cases, Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic has appeared to affect females more frequently than males. Since the chromosomal syndrome was originally described in the medical literature, over 20 cases have been reported. Other chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those potentially associated with Chromosome 14, Trisomy Mosaic.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such chromosomal disorders, choose the name of the specific disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)"\n', 'Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium (microorganism) treponema pallidum. It is transmitted by direct contact with an infected lesion, usually through sexual intercourse. When untreated, syphilis progresses through primary, secondary and latent stages. The early stages of syphilis may not have any detectable symptoms. In some cases, symptoms can remain dormant for years. Eventually any tissue or vascular organ in the body may be affected. Syphilis is caused by a bacterium (microorganism) known as treponema pallidum and acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. On rare occasions, health workers have become infected while examining affected individuals with infectious lesions. It may also be acquired by kissing someone with oral infectious lesions. Infected mothers can transmit syphilis to the fetus in the womb, a condition known as congenital syphilis. (For more information on this disorder choose “congenital syphilis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) A diagnosis of syphilis, which is often difficult because of mild or absent symptoms in early states, is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic symptoms. Blood tests may be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis, but may be difficult to interpret and often give false negative results. A physician may also obtain a small sample of tissue by scraping an ulcer or rash for microscopic study in order to determine the presence of the syphilis bacteria.\n', 'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A deficiency (CPT1A) is characterized by a sudden onset of liver failure and damage to the nervous system resulting from liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy), usually associated with fasting or illness. CPT1A deficiency is caused by an abnormality (mutation) in the CPT1A gene that results in the production of an abnormally functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 enzyme and decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. CPT1A deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Three types of CPT1A deficiency have been recognized:  The hepatic encephalopathy type usually occurs in children and is associated with a low level of ketones in the blood, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), enlarged liver, muscle weakness and elevated carnitine in the blood.  The adult-onset myopathy type is characterized by a sudden onset of muscle cramping associated with exercise without low blood sugar or liver dysfunction.  The third type is acute fatty liver of pregnancy that occurs when a pregnant woman with one abnormal CPT1A gene carries a fetus with two abnormal CPT1A genes and is associated with liver failure in the mother. CPT1A deficiency has been reported in approximately 30-40 individuals.   The incidence of this condition may be higher in the Hutterite populations in the northern United States and Canada and the Inuit populations in northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland.  This condition occurs with equal frequency in males and females. CPT1A deficiency is diagnosed by a combination of physical symptoms and laboratory testing. The typical laboratory findings include low levels of ketones, elevated liver transaminases, elevated ammonia and elevated total serum carnitine.  CPT1A enzyme activity on the cultured skin cells from affected individuals is 1-5% of normal. Molecular genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis if the enzyme test is abnormal.  Some state newborn screening programs perform screening for CPT1A deficiency by measuring the ratio of free to total carnitine in blood plasma or serum. Carrier testing for relatives is available using CPT1A enzyme testing or molecular genetic testing.\n', 'ALAD porphyria is an extremely rare disorder with few cases reported in the medical literature. Most cases have occurred in Europe. However, the disorder can potentially occur in any population. More males have been identified with ALAD porphyria than females in the medical literature, but the disorder affects probably males and females in equal numbers. Researchers suspect that some cases of ALAD porphyria go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate the true frequency of this disorder in the general population. The onset of ALAD porphyria is usually during infancy or childhood, but late-onset of the disorder (well into adult life) has also been reported.\n', 'Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficiency or absence of the enzymes sucrase and isomaltase. This enzyme complex (sucrase-isomaltase) assists in the breakdown of a certain sugars (i.e., sucrose) and certain products of starch digestion (dextrins). The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex is normally found within the tiny, finger-like projections (microvilli or brush border) lining the small intestine. When this enzyme complex is deficient, nutrients based on ingested sucrose and starch cannot be absorbed properly from the gut.\nSymptoms of this disorder become evident soon after sucrose or starches, as found in modified milk formulas with sucrose or polycose, are ingested by an affected infant. Breast-fed infants or those on lactose-only formula manifest no symptoms until such time as sucrose (found in fruit juices, solid foods, and/or some medications) is introduced into the diet. Symptoms are variable among affected individuals but usually include watery diarrhea, abdominal swelling (distension) and/or discomfort, among others. Intolerance to starch often disappears within the first few years of life and the symptoms of sucrose intolerance usually improve as the affected child ages. CSID is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. CSID is a metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is diagnosed in approximately 0.2 percent of North Americans. This disorder has a higher frequency among Greenland and Canadian Inuit populations, with a reported incidence of approximately 10 percent. In addition, researchers report a higher degree of homozygosity among these more frequently affected groups than among other groups. Also, as a diagnosis may be easily missed, especially in those individuals with mild symptoms, many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of this disorder than is actually reported in the medical literature.\n', 'The incidence of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis in the general population is unknown. The proportion of cases classified as “idiopathic” has diminished as advanced diagnostic techniques and a better molecular understanding of cholestatic diseases in general have allowed physicians to diagnose many infants as being affected with specific syndromes. In the past, these infants would have been included as having idiopathic neonatal hepatitis.\n', '"Seckel syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by growth delays prior to birth (intrauterine growth retardation) resulting in low birth weight. Growth delays continue after birth (postnatal), resulting in short stature (dwarfism). Other symptoms and physical features associated with Seckel syndrome include an abnormally small head (microcephaly); varying degrees of mental retardation; and/or unusual characteristic facial features including ""beak-like"" protrusion of the nose. Other facial features may include abnormally large eyes, a narrow face, malformed ears, and/or an unusually small jaw (micrognathia). In addition, some affected infants may exhibit permanent fixation of the fifth fingers in a bent position (clinodactyly), malformation (dysplasia) of the hips, dislocation of a bone in the forearm (radial dislocation), and/or other physical abnormalities. Seckel syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of this disorder is not known. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature since its original description in 1960."\n', 'Antley-Bixler syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause structural changes of the skull, bones of the face and other skeletal abnormalities. The disorder is typically associated with premature closure of joints (cranial sutures) between particular bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). Many affected infants and children also may have a prominent forehead, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), protruding eyes (proptosis), and low-set ears. This condition has been described in over 30 patients to date. The estimated prevalence for the condition is less than 1 in 1,000,000.\n', 'Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a group of rare chronic autoimmune disorders characterized by blistering lesions that primarily affect the various mucous membranes of the body. The mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes are most often affected. The mucous membranes of the nose, throat, genitalia, and anus may also be affected. The symptoms of MMP vary among affected individuals depending upon the specific site(s) involved and the progression of the disease. Blistering lesions eventually heal, sometimes with scarring. Progressive scarring may potentially lead to serious complications affecting the eyes and throat. In some cases, blistering lesions also form on the skin, especially in the head and neck area. The exact cause of MMP is unknown. Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a rare group of autoimmune blistering disorders that affects females twice as often as males. The average age of onset of MMP is during the seventh decade (60 to 70 years of age). However, the disorder can occur at any age. The exact incidence of MMP is unknown. Because the disorder is difficult to identify, many researchers believe it is under-diagnosed. A diagnosis of MMP is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and certain tests known as a biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. For a biopsy, a small sample of skin tissue is removed (biopsy) and microscopically examined. For direct immunofluorescence, a second biopsied skin sample is tested to detect the presence of the specific autoantibodies (e.g., IgA, IgG, and C3) that cause pemphigoid.\n', '"Filippi syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder that may be apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized by an unusual facial appearance, abnormalities of the fingers and toes, and mild to severe mental retardation. Primary physical findings include growth delays, webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers and toes, inward deviation or bending (clinodactyly) of the fifth fingers (""pinkies"") and microcephaly, condition that indicates that the head circumference is smaller than would be expected for an infant\'s age and sex. Filippi syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. The diagnosis of Filippi syndrome may be made at birth or during early infancy based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. Specialized testing, such as certain advanced imaging techniques, may also be conducted to detect or characterize particular findings that may be associated with the disorder."\n', 'Two types of hyperprolinemia are recognized by physicians and clinical researchers. Each represents an inherited inborn error of metabolism involving the amino acid, proline. Hyperprolinemia Type II is characterized by an abnormally high level of the amino acid proline in the blood.  Fevers associated with seizures are common and mild mental retardation may be present. Hyperprolinemia Type II is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. HP-II is recognized by elevated blood proline and elevated P-5-C levels in the urine. (Normal blood proline levels are about 450 units whereas elevated blood proline levels in subjects with HP-II reach 1900-2000 units.)\n', 'TM has a conservatively estimated incidence of between 1 and 8 new cases per million per year, or approximately 1400 new cases each year. Although this disease affects people of all ages, with a range of six months to 88 years, there are bimodal peaks between the ages of 10 to 19 years and 30 to 39 years. In addition, approximately 25% of cases are in children. There is no gender or familial association with TM. In 75-90% of cases TM is monophasic, yet a small percentage experience recurrent disease especially if there is a predisposing underlying illness. As mentioned above, TM may be a relatively uncommon manifestation of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren’s syndrome, and sarcoidosis. SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause that affects multiple organs and tissues in the body. SLE may cause TM that may even be recurrent. Sjogren’s disease is another autoimmune disease characterized by invasion and infiltration of the tear and salivary glands by white blood cells with resultant decreased production of these fluids leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. Several tests can support this diagnosis: the presence of a SS-A/SS-B antibody in the blood, ophthalmologic tests that confirm decreased tear production and the demonstration of lymphocytic infiltration in biopsy specimens of the small salivary glands (a minimally invasive procedure). Neurologic manifestations are unusual in Sjogren’s syndrome, but spinal cord inflammation can occur. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown cause and manifested by enlarged lymph nodes, lung inflammation, various skin lesions, liver and other organ involvement. In the nervous system, various nerves, as well as the spinal cord, may be involved. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by biopsy, demonstrating features of inflammation typical of sarcoidosis. (For more information on these disorders, search for the condition in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 3 is missing (deleted or monosomic). The range and severity of symptoms and findings may be variable. However, associated features often include growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency); severe to profound mental retardation; distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; eyebrows that grow together (synophrys); and/or excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis). Additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In many cases, Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p appears to occur spontaneously (de novo) for unknown reasons. Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Since the disorder was originally reported in 1978 (Verjaal M), approximately 34 cases have been described in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those associated with Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p.  Chromosomal analysis is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence, which has doubled in the last decade (based on national hospitalization data), is estimated to be between .09 and .56 per 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. However, these estimates may reflect cases reported in the medical literature and the disorder most likely is more common in the United States than estimated, particularly in infants and young children. The majority of cases are in children under the age of 6. Newborns (neonates) are at particular risk because they do not have fully developed immune systems, do not have neutralizing antibodies for the toxin, and their kidneys cannot fully clear toxins from the body yet. For similar reasons certain adults, specifically adults with a compromised immune system or poor kidney function, are at a greater risk than the general population of developing the disorder.\n', 'DM1 is estimated to affect about 1 in 8,000-20,000 people in the general population. However, the prevalence of DM1 and DM2 vary greatly among different countries and different ethnic groups. The incidence of DM2 is higher in Germany and Finland. Because some people with DM may go unrecognized or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of these disorders in the general population is difficult. Researchers have determined that DM is the most common form of adult onset muscular dystrophy.\n', 'Wolman disease is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. However, cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. Wolman disease is named after one of the physicians who first identified the disorder in the medical literature in 1956.\n', 'ANKRD11 KBG syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females. Currently, more than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The disorder can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determining the true frequency of KBG syndrome in the general population. A diagnosis of KBG syndrome may be suspected after a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient and family history, and the identification of characteristic physical findings. The diagnosis can also be made by gene panel analysis or next generation sequencing techniques, where multiple genetic causes of intellectual disability are investigated at the same time.\n', 'Symptoms of CMT disease usually begin gradually in adolescence, but can begin earlier or later. In almost all cases, the longest nerve fibers are affected first. Over time, affected individuals may lose the normal use of their feet, hands, legs and arms. Common red flags can include decreased sensitivity to heat, touch or pain, muscle weakness in the hand, foot or lower leg, trouble with fine motor skills, high-stepped gait (foot drop), loss of muscle mass in the lower leg, frequent tripping or falling, hammertoe, high foot arch and flat feet. Stretch reflexes may be lost. The disease is slowly progressive and variable and those affected may remain active for years and live a normal life span. In the most severe cases, breathing difficulties can hasten death. Symptoms of CMT hereditary neuropathy usually begin gradually sometime in adolescence, early adulthood or middle age. The condition affects an equal number of males and females. CMT hereditary neuropathy is the most common inherited neurological disorder affecting more than 250,000 Americans. Since this condition is frequently undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or diagnosed very late in life, the true number of affected persons may be higher. The diagnosis of CMT hereditary neuropathy can be challenging. The diagnosis is based on physical symptoms, family history and clinical tests. Clinical tests include nerve conduction velocity (NCV) which measures the speed at which impulses travel along the nerves and electromyogram (EMG) which records the electrical activity of muscle cell. . Molecular genetic testing is currently available for CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT1D, CMT2E, CMT4A, CMT4E, CMT4F and CMTX.\n', 'VKC symptoms include inflammation of the outer membrane of the eye. This causes the eyes to become red and may cause blurred vision. The eyes become sensitive to light and itch intensely. Usually both eyes are affected, and cobblestone-like changes appear in the upper eyelid linings (palpebral conjunctiva). In other patients, a gelatinous nodule may develop in the tissue adjacent to the cornea (limbus). In very severe cases, the corneas may scar (shield ulcers) or clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur, leading to temporarily or permanently reduced vision. Onset of VKC typically occurs at about 11 years of age, but onset can be between 3 and 25 years of age. The disorder appears to affect more males than females. Usually patients with VKC have a family history of atopic diseases, such as asthma, eczema, or rhinitis. It occurs most often during the spring or summer but up to 60% of patients experience recurrences in the winter periodically. It is more present in climates that are dry and warm.\n', 'Serpiginous Choroiditis is one of the conditions in a group termed the white dot syndromes which all involve inflammation of the retina and choroid and are defined by the appearance of white dots in the posterior inner part of the eye (fundus). Serpiginous Choroiditis is a rare recurrent eye disorder characterized by irregularly shaped (serpiginous) lesions involving two layers of the eye surface (the retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris). No symptoms are apparent unless a specific area of the retina (macula) is damaged. A sudden, painless decrease in vision in one or both eyes may be the first sign of Serpiginous Choroiditis. Patients may also notice blind gaps in the visual field (scotomata) or a sensation of flashes of light (photopsia). Both eyes are commonly affected, although the second eye may not develop lesions for weeks to years after the first eye. The exact cause of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not known. The exact cause of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not known.  Symptoms develop due to lesions that damage the part of the retina that absorbs short wavelengths of light (macular region).  Vision loss may also occur if a membrane composed of fibers and blood vessels (subretinal neovascular membrane) develops and then moves into the macular region.  It has been suggested in the medical literature that an abnormal immune response may cause inflammation of the blood vessels (localized vasculitis) of the eye, leading to the development of Serpiginous Choroiditis.  Some scientists suggest that the disorder is one of impaired blood circulation in the eye membranes.  A few affected individuals have been reported to have had chronic exposure to an unusual variety of chemicals, but the relationship between this exposure and the development of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not clear at this time. Serpiginous Choroiditis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females.  Symptoms usually appear during the early to middle adult years.\n', 'Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is an infectious disease that belongs to a group of diseases known as the spotted fever group rickettsioses. It is caused by infection with the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii (R. rickettsii), which is usually transmitted by a tick bite. When introduced into the body, the bacterium spreads by the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels and multiplies within and damages certain cells lining the inside of small blood (vascular) vessels (i.e., endothelial cells) as well as vascular smooth muscle cells. Such damage leads to inflammatory changes of affected blood vessels (vasculitis), leakage of fluid from the blood vessels, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in body tissues (edema), and additional abnormalities, resulting in the symptoms and findings associated with the disease.\n', 'Kenny-Caffey syndrome type 2 (KCS2) is an extremely rare hereditary skeletal disorder characterized by thickening of the long bones, thin marrow cavities in the bones (medullary stenosis), and abnormalities affecting the head and eyes. Most cases are obvious at birth (congenital). The primary outcome of KCS2 is short stature. Intelligence is usually normal. Individuals with KCS may also have recurrent episodes of low levels of calcium in the blood stream (hypocalcemia) that is caused by insufficient production of parathyroid hormones (hypoparathyroidism). In most cases, KCS2 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. KCS2 is an extremely rare skeletal disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 60 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Onset of hypocalcemia is usually within two to three months of life; the hypocalcemia is not permanent (transient). In an adult, episodes of hypocalcemia may be due to stress or follow surgery or illness. KCS2 was first described in the medical literature in 1966. The diagnosis of KCS2 may be confirmed by x-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal distinctive thickening of the outer layers (cortexes) of long bones along with unusually thin marrow cavities. Blood tests can detect episodes of low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia).\n', 'Hereditary orotic aciduria is an extremely rare genetic disorder. When untreated, affected infants can develop a blood (hematologic) disorder called megaloblastic anemia as well as failure to thrive, susceptibility to infection, and orotic acid crystals in the urine (crystalluria) resulting from excretion of orotic acid in the urine. Impaired neurological development has been observed, but invariably, especially since a treatment has become available. Hereditary orotic aciduria is an extremely rare disorder that affects both men and women. Only about 20 individuals with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. The birth prevalence, which is the number of babies born with a disorder compared to the total number of live births, is estimated to be less than 1 in 1,000,000 live births. Because rare diseases often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is extremely difficult.\n', "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. It is characterized by the progressive degeneration and eventual death of nerve cells (motor neurons) in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that facilitate communication between the nervous system and voluntary muscles of the body. Ordinarily, motor neurons in the brain (upper motor neurons) sent messages to motor neurons in the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) and then to various muscles. ALS affects both the upper and lower motor neurons, so that the transmission of messages is interrupted, and muscles gradually weaken and waste away. As a result, the ability to initiate and control voluntary movement is lost. Ultimately, ALS leads to respiratory failure because affected individuals lose the ability to control muscles in the chest and diaphragm. ALS is often called Lou Gehrig's disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder that affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States.  Although the median age at which symptoms develop is 55 years, symptoms may begin at any adult age.  ALS affects more males than females.  Approximately 60 percent of those affected are men; 40 percent of affected individuals are women.  An estimated 5,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the U.S.\n", 'Crouzon syndrome affects males and females. Some articles in the medical literature report that males are affected more often than females. Crouzon syndrome is estimated to affect about 1.6 in 100,000 people in the general population. All forms of craniosynostosis are estimated to affect about 1 in 2,000-2,5000 live births.\n', 'MPS III is classified as a rare disease with incidence reported to be between 0.28 and 4.1 cases per 100,000 births. MPS IIIA is the most common subtype affecting around 1 in 100 000 births, closely followed by type B at 1 in 200,000. In some countries in Southern Europe, type B has been reported to be more common than A. MPS IIIC and IIID are rarer with reported incidences of approximately 1 in 1.5 million and 1 in 1 million births respectively.\n', "Chromosome 8, Monosomy 8p is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the eighth chromosome. Associated symptoms and findings may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, common features include growth deficiency; mental retardation; malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, such as a small head (microcephaly) and vertical skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); heart (cardiac) abnormalities; and/or genital defects in affected males. Additional craniofacial features may also be present that tend to become less apparent with age, such as a short, broad nose; a low, wide nasal bridge; and/or a small jaw (micrognathia). In most cases, Chromosome 8, Monosomy 8p appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development that occur for unknown reasons. Chromosome 8, Monosomy 8p appears to affect males and  females in relatively equal numbers.  Since the disorder was originally described in 1973, over 20 cases have  been reported in the medical literature.\n", 'Catamenial pneumothorax is an extremely rare condition that affects women. Pneumothorax is the medical term for a collapsed lung, a condition in which air or gas is trapped in the space surrounding the lungs causing the lungs to collapse. Women with catamenial pneumothorax have recurrent episodes of pneumothorax that occur within 72 hours before or after the start of menstruation. The exact cause of catamenial pneumothorax is unknown and several theories have been proposed. Some cases are associated with the abnormal development of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus (endometriosis), although the exact nature of this relationship in these cases is unknown. A diagnosis of catamenial pneumothorax is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic symptoms (i.e., repeated episodes of pneumothorax in conjunction with the onset of menses). A variety of tests may be required to rule out other conditions and to identify associated conditions such as thoracic or pelvic endometriosis or damage to the diaphragm. A minimally invasive procedure known as video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) may be used as a diagnostic aid. During a VATS procedure, a 1-cm rigid tube (thoracoscope) with a tiny, fiber-optic camera at the end is passed through a small incision in the chest. This allows physicians to examine the lungs, chest cavity and diaphragm.\n', 'VPS13B/COH1 Cohen syndrome affects males and females in about equal numbers. It appears to occur more frequently in people of Finnish, Amish, Greek/Mediterranean and Irish ancestry. More than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature and an estimated 500-1,000 individuals have been diagnosed with the disorder worldwide. However, instances of Cohen syndrome often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.\n', 'The most common first sign of RMC is blood in the urine (hematuria) and patients may also feel pain in their flank around the kidney area or (less commonly) feel a mass in their abdomen, usually on the right side. About half of the patients with RMC will begin losing weight unintentionally and may develop fevers and night sweats.\n', 'Williams syndrome, also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation), short stature, a varying degree of mental deficiency, and distinctive facial features that typically become more pronounced with age. Such characteristic facial features may include a round face, full cheeks, thick lips, a large mouth that is usually held open, and a broad nasal bridge with nostrils that flare forward (anteverted nares). Affected individuals may also have unusually short eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), flared eyebrows, a small lower jaw (mandible), and prominent ears. Dental abnormalities may also occur including abnormally small, underdeveloped teeth (hypodontia) with small, slender roots. Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and infants of any race may be affected. The prevalence of this disorder is approximately one in 10,000-20,000 births in the United States. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation that includes a detailed patient history and specialized blood tests that may detect elevated levels of calcium in the blood. Another test, known as fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH], may be used to determine whether a deletion of one elastin gene on chromosome 7 is present. This deletion is believed to occur in the majority of individuals with Williams Syndrome.\n', 'Eosinophilic fasciitis affects both sexes. Some reports suggest that women are affected with greater frequency than men. The disorder can occur at any age (with age at diagnosis ranging from 1-88), but most often occurs in individuals between 30-60 years of age. It occurs with greater frequency in Caucasians. Approximately 300 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is an acquired progressive muscle disorder that becomes apparent during adulthood. The symptoms and progression of sIBM vary from one person to another. In most cases, sIBM is characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of the muscles especially those of the arms and the legs. sIBM can progress to cause severe disability. sIBM is an autoimmune disease mediated by cytotoxic T cells, but the exact cause of the disorder is unknown. sIBM, like all autoimmune diseases, is a complex disorder and, most likely, multiple factors including genetic, immunological and environmental ones in combination all play a role in its development.\n', 'GCPS affects males and females in equal numbers. There have been over 200 patients with this disorder reported in the medical literature. However, because some affected individuals may exhibit few and/or mild symptoms, they may never be diagnosed with the disorder. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of GCPS in the general population.\n', 'Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain disorder that develops in some individuals with liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex disorder that encompasses a spectrum or continuum of disease that ranges from a subtle condition with no outward signs or symptoms to a severe form that can cause serious, life-threatening complications. Symptoms are related to progressive dysfunction of the brain and may include personality changes, intellectual impairment, impaired memory and loss of consciousness (coma). Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in individuals with acute or chronic liver (hepatic) disease or in individuals whose liver is bypassed by a portosystemic shunt (with no liver disease present). A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal passageway that allows blood from the gastrointestinal tract to bypass the liver. They can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired during life. Hepatic encephalopathy is caused when toxins that are normally cleared from the body by the liver accumulate in the blood, eventually traveling to the brain. Many of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are reversible when promptly detected and treated. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy may be suspected in some individuals with liver disease based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests that are used to rule out other conditions. Such tests may include a complete blood count, liver function tests, tests that evaluate serum ammonia levels, and an electroencephalogram, which is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain, may be useful in detecting encephalopathy. Specialized imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans may be used to rule out other conditions affecting the brain such as tumors.\n', "Retinoschisis means splitting of the eye's retina into two layers. There are two forms of this disorder. The most common is an acquired form that affects both men and women. It usually occurs in middle age or beyond, although it can occur earlier, and it is sometimes known as senile retinoschisis. The other form is present at birth (congenital) and affects mostly boys and young men. It is known as juvenile, X-linked retinoschisis.\n", 'Pinta is a rare infectious tropical disease affecting the skin that is caused by the bacterium Treponema carateum, which is transmitted by direct, nonsexual contact. Pinta progresses through three distinct stages, which are characterized by various skin lesions and discoloration. Other organ systems are not affected. Exposed areas of the skin such as the face and extremities are most often affected. Pinta is an infectious tropical disease caused by the spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete) known as Treponema carateum. A diagnosis of pinta is suspected based upon a detailed patient history (e.g., recent travel to endemic area), a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of tests. These tests may include the microscopic examination of tissue samples (darkfield examination) from the skin lesions of affected individuals. Other blood tests (e.g., VDRL and Treponemal antibody absorption test [FTA-ABS]) usually become positive only after the secondary skin lesions appear.\n', 'Smith-Magenis syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 15,000-25,000 people in the general population in the United States. However, cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of SMS in the general population. SMS has been reported throughout the world and in all ethnic groups.\n', 'RVCL-S affects males and females with equivalent frequency and commonly begins in middle age (35-45 years). It is commonly first noticed as eye symptoms (increased ‘floaters’ or ‘blind spots’). Patients have been identified in a number of countries including the USA, Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Australia. It has not been identified in Africans.\n', 'Dengue Fever is an acute viral infection characterized by fever. It is caused by a bite from mosquitoes carrying dengue virus. The primary form of Dengue Fever is characterized by a skin rash and a high fever with severe pain in the head and muscles. Other symptoms may include shaking chills, diarrhea, and vomiting. Bouts of extreme exhaustion may last for months after the initial symptoms. Dengue Fever is caused by a virus that belongs to a family of viruses known as Flaviviruses.   There is no vaccine, so travelers going to parts of the world where it is endemic during Dengue season (July to November) are urged to protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing and mosquito repellant. Dengue Fever occurs mainly in subtropical or tropical climates including southern Asia, South America (particularly Brazil), and the Caribbean including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The virus has also been imported into the United States by tourists from these areas. It is thought that approximately 200 cases of Dengue Fever are unknowingly carried into the United States each year.\n', 'Riboflavin transporter deficiency is believed to affect females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. As of November 2017, about 165 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature or to the Cure RTD Registry. Rare disorders like riboflavin transporter deficiency often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Researchers believe that these disorders are underdiagnosed; one estimate suggests that at least 1 in 1,000,000 people in the general population have riboflavin transporter deficiency.\n', 'Chikungunya is a rare viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by a rash, fever, and severe joint pain (arthralgias) that usually lasts for three to seven days. Because of its effect on the joints, Chikungunya has been classified among the Arthritic Viruses. It primarily occurs in tropical areas of the world. Chikungunya is an infectious tropical disease caused by a virus that belongs to the group of A arboviruses.  It is transmitted by various species of mosquitoes.  Monkeys may also be infected with this virus.  Some cases of this infection appear to have occurred through casual human to human contact, but it is not known how it is transmitted among humans. Chikungunya is a viral disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It primarily affects children and young adults in Africa, Southeast Asia, and India.  A large outbreak of Chikungunya occurred in Tanganyika, Africa in 1953. This disorder is rare outside of tropical areas of the world. The diagnosis of Chikungunya may be confirmed by a specialized blood test that detects immune responses to the virus (ELISA test). The symptoms of Chikungunya improve spontaneously after several weeks. There is no specific treatment. However, bed rest and antiinflammatory medications (i.e., ibuprofen) may be useful. As with other viral diseases, antibiotics are not effective in treating this disease.\n', 'Central pain syndrome is estimated to affect several million people worldwide. Approximately, 5-10% of individuals who suffer a stroke, 20-40% of spinal cord injury patients, almost 30% of patients suffering multiple sclerosis and an uncertain number with other conditions develop central pain.\n', 'Jansen type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of Jansen type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia may be suspected during infancy or early childhood. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and a variety of specialized tests, particularly advanced imaging techniques. These techniques include x-ray studies that may reveal abnormal development of the large (bulbous) ends (metaphyses) of certain bones of the body, particularly those of the arms and legs. Laboratory tests that detect abnormally high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) and blood (hypercalcemia) are helpful in confirming the diagnosis.\n', 'Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT; SEDL) is a rare, hereditary skeletal disorder that only affects males. Physical characteristics include moderate short stature (dwarfism), moderate-to-severe spinal deformities, barrel-shaped chest, disproportionately short trunk, and premature osteoarthritis. SEDT does not exhibit any ethnic predisposition. Affected individuals have been described in European, American, Asian, and Australian populations (but not in African-Americans to date). One estimate suggests that the incidence is 2 persons per million.\n', 'Osteomyelitis is a prevalent condition that affects males and females in equal numbers. Osteomyelitis more commonly affects people younger than 20, or adults older than 50 years of age. While there is a higher incidence of bone infections in adults that live in developing countries, hemodialysis patients, injection drug users, and patients with diabetes are also more susceptible to this infection. Osteomyelitis that is the result of an infection that has spread through the blood occurs more commonly in children than adults. Inoculation or direct osteomyelitis tends to happen more in younger individuals in the setting of trauma and related surgery. When direct osteomyelitis does occur in adults, it is usually secondary to an infected ulcer from diabetes or an infection from a total joint replacement.\n', 'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia can affect both males and females. The exact incidence of BPD is unknown. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 10,000-15,000 babies born in the United States develop BPD each year. The risk of developing BPD increases the earlier a baby is born and the lower the birth weight. Infants born weighing less than 2.2 pounds are at the greatest risk for developing BPD. The number of cases of BPD has been increasing most likely because of modern advances in medicine, which have enabled doctors to keep more low birth weight, premature babies alive than in the past. BPD was first described in the medical literature in 1967. A diagnosis of BPD is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including blood tests, chest x-rays, and echocardiograms. Blood tests may show low levels of oxygen in the blood. Chest x-rays may show distinctive changes in the lungs including abnormal development of the lungs. An echocardiogram is used to rule out other conditions that can cause breathing difficulties in infants such as congenital heart defects. During an echocardiogram, sound waves are directed toward the heart, enabling physicians to study cardiac function and motion.\n', 'DMC and SMS syndromes are rare genetic disorders. As of 2007 there were over 90 individuals with DMC or SMS reported in the literature (Lachman, 2007, p 934) who were from a number of different ethnic groups (El Ghouzzi et al. 2003; Pogue et al. 2005; Aglan et al. 2009). A diagnosis of DMC syndrome may be suspected upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic clinical findings, e.g., barrel chest and disproportionate short stature. Radiographs may confirm specific skeletal abnormalities and findings consistent with DMC syndrome and includes notching of the vertebral bodies, lacy appearance of the iliac crest, and small and malformed carpal bones. Alternatively, gene testing for mutations in DYM can be done.\n', '"Yaws is an infectious tropical disease caused by the spirochete (spiral shaped) bacterium known as Treponema pertenue. The disease presents in three stages of which the first and second are easily treated. The third, however, may involve complex changes to the bones in many parts of the body. The first stage is characterized by the appearance of small, painless bumps on the skin that group together and grow until they resemble a strawberry. The skin may break open, forming an ulcer. The second stage (usually starting several weeks or months after the first) presents with a crispy, crunchy rash that may cover arms, legs, buttocks and/or face. If the bottoms of the feet are involved, walking is painful and the stage is known as ""crab yaws."" Stage 3 yaws involves the long bones, joints, and/or skin. Yaws is very common in tropical areas of the world but it is not known in the United States. It is not a sexually transmitted disease. It occurs in children younger than 15 years of age. Yaws is an infectious disease caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete) known as Treponema pertenue.  Yaws is usually transmitted by direct contact with the infected skin sores of affected individuals. In some cases, yaws may be transmitted through the bite of an infected insect. The diagnosis of stage 1 and stage 2 yaws is made by microscopic examination of tissue samples (darkfield examination) from the skin lesions of affected individuals. Stage 3 yaws may be diagnosed by specialized blood tests (i.e., VDRL and treponemal antibodies)."\n', '"Chromosome 18q- syndrome (also known as Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18q) is a rare chromosomal disorder in which there is deletion of part of the long arm (q) of chromosome 18. Associated symptoms and findings may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, characteristic features include short stature; mental retardation; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); malformations of the hands and feet; and abnormalities of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, such as a small head (microcephaly), a ""carp-shaped"" mouth, deeply set eyes, prominent ears, and/or unusually flat, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia). Some affected individuals may also have visual abnormalities, hearing impairment, genital malformations, structural heart defects, and/or other physical abnormalities. Chromosome 18q- syndrome usually appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early during embryonic development that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). Chromosome 18q- syndrome appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three to two.  Since the disorder was originally reported in the medical literature in 1964, more than 80 cases have been recorded."\n', "Chilaiditi's syndrome is a rare condition in which a portion of the colon is abnormally located (interposed) in between the liver and the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen. Chilaiditi's syndrome can cause a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and small bowel obstruction. The specific symptoms and presentation of Chilaiditi's syndrome can vary greatly from one person to another. The cause of Chilaiditi's syndrome is not fully understood. Chilaiditi’s syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. It is more common in older adults, but can occur at any age and has been reported in children. The incidence of Chilaiditi’s syndrome is unknown. One published report estimated the incidence at .025-.28 percent of the general population. Chilaiditi’s syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1910 by a Greek radiologist named Demetrius Chilaiditi. A diagnosis of Chilaiditi's syndrome is made based upon imaging (radiographic) confirmation of the abnormal positioning of the colon and the occurrence of associated symptoms. Such imaging techniques may include chest and abdominal x- rays, ultrasounds, or computerized tomography (CT) scanning.\n", 'CARASIL is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is characterized by damage to the small blood vessels in the brain. Individuals with CARASIL are at risk of developing multiple strokes, even if they do not have cardiovascular risk factors. The symptoms of CARASIL result from damage to various small blood vessels, especially those within the brain. Individuals with CARASIL may develop a variety of symptoms relating to white matter involvement or leukoaraiosis (changes in deep white matter in the brain, which are observed on MRI or CT). Such symptoms include an increasing muscle tone (spasticity), pyramidal signs, and pseudobulbar palsy. Pseudobulbar palsy is a group of neurologic symptoms including difficult chewing, swallowing and speech. Eventually, gait disturbance and dementia may result. About a third of patients have stroke-like episodes. The age of onset is between 20 to 50 years old. CARASIL is an acronym that stands for: CARASIL is an extremely rare disorder that has been mainly described in the Japanese medical literature, but also reported in Chinese and Caucasian populations. Gender disparity has not been determined. The exact incidence of CARASIL is unknown. Some researchers believe that CARASIL often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of this condition in the general population.\n', 'Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type is a rare inherited skin disorder. It is characterized by scaling skin (ichthyosis) ranging from mild to severe. The patches of scaly, thickened skin range from spotty to severe, and may appear on almost any part of the body. Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type is characterized by patches of abnormally thick, hard skin that may appear almost anywhere on the body.  Some clinicians describe the skin as “horn-like”. With treatment, the patches may be considerably reduced.  Under examination by electron microscopy, numerous cells (keratinocytes) with two nuclei are found. Frequently, the nuclei are surrounded by shells of a primitive, precursor protein of the skin. Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth Macklin type is a rare disorder present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type is treated by applying skin softening (emollient) ointments, preferably plain petroleum jelly. This can be especially effective after bathing while the skin is still moist. Salicylic acid gel is another particularly effective ointment. The skin should be covered at night with an airtight, waterproof dressing when this ointment is used. Lactate lotion can also be an effective treatment for this disorder.\n', 'Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the long arm (q) of the 11th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Although associated symptoms and findings may vary, the disorder is often associated with delayed growth before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation); varying degrees of mental retardation; distinctive abnormalities of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; and/or other features. Chromosomal analysis is necessary for a definite diagnosis. Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q is a very rare chromosomal disorder that is reported to affect more females than males.  Approximately 45 cases of this disorder have been documented in the medical literature. Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q may be diagnosed through genetic testing, either during pregnancy (prenatally) or after birth (postnatally). Prenatal procedures such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, and fetal blood sampling involve chromosomal analysis of fluid and/or tissue samples extracted from the fetus or the uterus during pregnancy (prenatally).\n', 'Some type of EB occurs in an estimated 1 out of every 50,000 live births. The disorder occurs in every racial and ethnic group throughout the world and affects both sexes equally. Any blistering disorder in the newborn period may mimic EB. These include herpes simplex virus, epidermolytic ichthyosis, bullous impetigo and incontinentia pigmenti. Clinical diagnosis of the type of EB based on presentation in the neonatal period should be avoided as all types of EB may look alike in this age group. When EB is suspected, a skin biopsy should be obtained and sent to an appropriate laboratory to confirm the diagnosis with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or immunofluorescent antibody/antigen mapping. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in most of the genes known to be associated with the various types of EB is clinically available.\n', '"Asherson\'s syndrome is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the development, over a period of hours, days or weeks, of rapidly progressive blood clots affecting multiple organ systems of the body. Conditions such as infections, immunizations, wounds caused due to physical trauma and failure in the anticoagulation mechanism of the body usually act as ""triggers"". Approximately 300 individuals have been identified with Asherson’s syndrome since the disorder was first defined in the medical literature in 1992. More women have been affected than men. The disorder can occur at any age, although most cases have been reported in young adults."\n', 'Cryptococcosis is caused by a fungus known as Cryptococcosis neoformans. The infection may be spread to humans through contact with pigeon droppings or unwashed raw fruit. Contact with an infected individual may also spread the infection. Individuals with disorders characterized by lowered immunity (for instance, HIV infection) are at high risk for contracting these infections. Cryptococcosis is caused by the fungus Cyptococcus neoformans.  It is spread by contact with pigeon droppings, unwashed raw fruit or by infected individuals.  People with immune deficiencies or lowered immunity (such as people undergoing cancer chemotherapy or organ transplants or those infected with HIV-AIDS) are at high risk for contracting this fungal infection. Cryptococcosis occurs worldwide.  In the United States it occurs predominately in the Southeastern states and usually in adults aged forty to sixty years of age.  It tends to occur more often in males than females. Individuals with disorders involving reduced or impaired immunity to infection are particularly at risk. The diagnosis depends on proof of the presence of Cyptococcus neoformans in either a bodily fluid or body tissue. The presence of the fungus may be seen under a light microscope in some circumstances; other circumstances require growing the organism from samples of fluid taken from a patient. An immunological test designed to detect the substance that would be mobilized in the body to fight this fungus if it were present (antigen) is available in commercial kits.\n', 'Ear-patella-short stature syndrome (EPS), also known as Meier-Gorlin syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by small ears (microtia), absent or small knee caps (patellae), and short stature. Additional findings may include various skeletal abnormalities, early feeding difficulties, and poor weight gain. In addition, characteristic features of the head and face may be present including a small mouth (microstomia), with full lips, small circumference of the head (microcephaly), and/or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the upper (maxillary) and/or lower (mandibular) jaw bones (micrognathia). EPS is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Since EPS was first described in 1959 only about thirty-five cases have been reported in the medical literature (June, 2005). Researchers believe the disorder is under-diagnosed making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. EPS is believed to affect males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'The exact cause of GCC is unknown. One study has suggested a possible connection between schistosomiasis (a parasitic infection found in certain tropical and subtropical countries) and GCC, however a causal relationship has not been established and the vast majority of GCC occur in the absence of schistosomiasis. Recent studies have shown that GCCs do have a unique genomic profile distinct from adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix which may offer future targetable pathways for treatment. There are no genetic, familial or environmental factors known to cause this disorder. It does not run in families. GCC is very rare with approximately 1 case per 2 million individuals. The average age at the time of diagnosis is most frequently reported between 50-55. While most studies have reported that men and women are affected in equal numbers, a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women (2-3:1). Advanced GCCs tend to present more frequently in women and 15-30% of women are initially diagnosed with an ovarian cancer. Less than 1% of GCCs are accurately diagnosed prior to surgery. Because there are no unique features of GCC on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of GCC cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. GCCs tend to be easier to identify because of the unique combination of neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.\n', 'Duane syndrome has been seen in diverse ethnic groups. The frequency of DS in the general population of individuals with eye movement disorders (strabismus) is approximately one to 5 percent. Most individuals are diagnosed by the age of 10 years. The female to male ratio of individuals with DS is approximately 60:40, showing a slightly higher preponderance of female patients.\n', 'It is estimated that, of the entire population who contract histoplasmosis, far less than 1% has the excessive healing response to the fungal infection that is the basis of FM. Reliable prevalence information is not available, but the affected population of histoplasmosis-related fibrosing mediastinitis is estimated to be several hundred people in the United States. Post histo FM is seen only in individuals who lived in an endemic region sometime during their life. The number of persons with idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis is estimated to be several dozen in the United States.\n', '"A uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from the smooth muscle lining the walls of the uterus (myometrium). There are essentially two types of muscles in the body: voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles; the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, the myometrium stretches during pregnancy to help accommodate the fetus and contracts during labor to help push out a baby during childbirth. Leiomyosarcoma is a form of cancer. The term ""cancer"" refers to a group of diseases characterized by abnormal, uncontrolled cellular growth that invades surrounding tissues and may spread (metastasize) to distant bodily tissues or organs via the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, or other means. Different forms of cancer, including leiomyosarcomas, may be classified based upon the cell type involved, the specific nature of the malignancy, and the disease\'s clinical course. Leiomyosarcoma is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma. Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from the connective tissue, which connects, supports and surrounds various structures and organs in the body. Soft tissue includes fat, muscle, never, tendons, tissue surrounding the joints (synovial tissue), and blood and lymph vessels. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown."\n', "Asherman's syndrome is an uncommon, acquired, gynecological disorder characterized by changes in the menstrual cycle. Patients experience reduced menstrual flow, increased cramping and abdominal pain, eventual cessation of menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), and, in many instances, infertility. Most often these symptoms are the result of severe inflammation of the lining of the uterus (endometriosis) that is caused by the development of bands of scar tissue that join parts of the walls of the uterus to one another, thus reducing the volume of the uterine cavity (intrauterine adhesions and synechiae).  Endometrial scarring and intrauterine adhesions may occur as a result of surgical scraping or cleaning of tissue from the uterine wall (dilatation and curettage [D and C]), infections of the endometrium (e.g., tuberculosis), or other factors. Asherman’s syndrome is limited to females. Unless the physician is careful, the diagnosis of Asherman's syndrome may be needlessly overlooked. A simple X-ray of the uterus with a small tube placed in the cervix is usually diagnostic. However, many physicians will, in order to save time, use a small balloon catheter placed in the uterus. The latter technique will overlook a number of cases of this syndrome. The gold standard for diagnosis uses a hysteroscope that pictures the interior of the uterus directly.\n", 'Hydranencephaly is a central nervous system disorder characterized by an enlarged head and neurological deficits. The exact cause of Hydranencephaly is not known. This extremely rare form of Hydrocephalus involves the absence of portions of the brain. Results of neurologic examination in newborns may be normal or abnormal. The head usually appears enlarged at birth. Vision impairment, lack of growth and intellectual deficits are symptomatic of this disorder. Hydranencephaly can usually be detected at birth due to an enlarged head. Some infants may appear healthy at birth but may later fail to grow at a normal rate.  Irritability, poor feeding, infantile spasms or seizures,  and spasticity or rigidity of arms and legs are symptomatic of this disorder.  Some affected individuals may experience an exaggeration of muscular reflexes (hyperreflexia) and/or increased muscle tone (hypertonia).  Poor body temperature regulation, vision impairment and mental retardation may also occur. Hydranencephaly is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'Tyrosinemia type I is a rare autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disorder characterized by lack of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), which is needed for the final break down of the amino acid tyrosine. Failure to properly break down tyrosine leads to abnormal accumulation of tyrosine and its metabolites in the liver, potentially resulting in severe liver disease. Tyrosine may also accumulate in the kidneys and central nervous system. Tyrosinemia type I affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1 in 100,000 to 120,000 births worldwide. In Quebec, Canada, the birth prevalence is estimated to be 1/16,000. The estimated prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec is one in 1,850 births. In Norway, the birth prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 60,000 births.\n', '"Low gamma-GT (GGT) familial intrahepatic cholestasis refers to a spectrum of disease, ranging from mild to severe cases. This spectrum of disease predominantly affects the liver. A variety of disorders leads to low GGT familial intrahepatic cholestasis. Children with defects in bile acid synthesis or conjugation, children with abnormalities of contact between liver cells, children with abnormalities of cell organization manifest as arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis syndrome, and children with ""neonatal hemochromatosis"" all may have low GGT familial intrahepatic cholestasis. These disorders are not covered in this report. A diagnosis of low GGT familial intrahepatic cholestasis should be suspected in infants and children with evidence of cholestasis. A diagnosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of tests. These tests include measuring serum levels of bilirubin, bile salts, and gamma-glutamyltransferase. Surgical excision and microscopic examination of liver tissue (biopsy) may be performed to aid in diagnosis and to detect the presence of cirrhosis. Molecular genetic testing is available on a clinical basis."\n', 'Chromosome 10, monosomy 10p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 10 is missing (deleted or monosomic). The range and severity of symptoms and findings may be variable, depending upon the exact size or location of the deletion on chromosome 10p. However, associated features often include severe intellectual disability; growth delays after birth (postnatal growth retardation); distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; a short neck; and/or structural defects of the heart that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). Several cases have also been reported in which affected individuals have some features of DiGeorge syndrome (DGS). DGS is a congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands, potentially causing abnormalities of the immune system, deficient production of parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism), a heart defect, and associated findings. In many cases, chromosome 10, monosomy 10p appears to occur spontaneously (de novo) for unknown reasons. Chromosome 10, monosomy 10p is typically evident at birth (congenital). Since the disorder was originally reported in the medical literature in 1970, over 46 cases have been recorded. In such observed cases, males appear to be more frequently affected than females.\n', 'Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe periorbital headaches, along with decreased and painful eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). Symptoms usually affect only one eye (unilateral). In most cases, affected individuals experience intense sharp pain and decreased eye movements. Symptoms often will subside without intervention (spontaneous remission) and may recur without a distinct pattern (randomly). Affected individuals may exhibit signs of paralysis (palsy) of certain cranial nerves such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. The affected eye often abnormally protrudes (proptosis). The exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). While the exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is unknown, one theory is an abnormal autoimmune response linked with an inflammation in a specific area behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). In some cases, inflammation may be due to a clumping of a certain type of cell (granulomatous inflammation). Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Other possible causes may include generalized inflammation and constricted or inflamed cranial blood vessels. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs in males and females in equal numbers. The average age of onset is 41 years, but there have been cases reported among people younger than age 30. In rare cases, children under the age of 10 have been diagnosed with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.\n', "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which are related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). Functioning as part of the immune system, the lymphatic system helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), comprising about 2 to 7 percent of adult NHLs in the United States and Europe.  The disease primarily affects older adults, with males representing approximately three-quarters of those with MCL.  Many affected individuals are diagnosed in their late 50s or early to mid 60s.  Reports suggest that most individuals with MCL have advanced (i.e., stage III or stage IV) disease at diagnosis.  (For further information on stages, please see the “Standard Therapies: Diagnosis” [“Stages”] section of this report below.)\n", 'Given the limited number of patients available for characterization, the full extent of symptoms is yet to be described. The most common features observed include absence seizures, myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (onset from 7 months to 6 years, mean 3.7 years) and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. Speech difficulties and behavioral problems have been described. The most common EEG pattern observed comprises irregular, high ample, and generalized spike-and-waves. To date, the most extensive patient collection was published by Johannesen et al5 and includes 34 patients. In this cohort, cognitive development was impaired in 33/34 (97%) subjects; 28/34 (82%) had mild to moderate intellectual disability, with language impairment being the most common feature. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31/34 patients with a mean onset at 3.7 years. Cognitive assessment before epilepsy onset was available in 24/31 subjects and was normal in 25% (6/24). Two patients had speech delay only, and 1 had severe intellectual disability. After epilepsy onset, cognition declined in 46% (11 out of 24) of patients. The most common seizure types were absences, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. Sixteen patients (47%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for myoclonic-atonic epilepsy. Seven additional patients had different forms of generalized epilepsy, and two had focal epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) findings were available in 27/31 patients showing irregular bursts of diffuse 2.5-3.5 Hz spikes/polyspikes-and-slow waves in 25/31. Two patients developed an EEG pattern resembling electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Ataxia was observed in 7 out of 34 patients of Epiletic Encephalopathy (21%).\n', 'Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Common symptoms include headaches, fevers, drowsiness, hyperactivity, and/or general weakness. The disorder may have some symptoms similar to those associated with meningitis, such as a stiff neck, altered reflexes, confusion, and/or speech abnormalities. Skin lesions usually are not found in association with herpes simplex encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus known as herpes simplex virus (HSV). Herpes simplex encephalitis usually occurs during early childhood or adulthood. It affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is the most common form of acute encephalitis in the United States with approximately 2,000 cases occurring per year. It accounts for 10 percent of all cases of encephalitis in the United States per year. A diagnosis of idiopathic herpes simplex encephalitis is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. These tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may confirm infection of CSF with the herpes simplex virus. In some cases, advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be beneficial in diagnosing a case of herpes simplex encephalitis.\n', 'Alexander disease has been estimated to occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1 million births. No racial, ethnic, geographic, or sex preference has been observed, nor is any expected given the de novo (new) nature of the mutations responsible for most cases. Although initially diagnosed primarily in young children, it is now being observed with similar frequency at all ages.\n', 'The spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs), are characterized by degeneration of nerve cells (motor nuclei) within the lowest region of the brain (lower brainstem) and certain motor neurons in the spinal cord (anterior horn cells) leading to muscle weakness of the truncal, and extremity muscles initially, followed by chewing, swallowing and breathing difficulties. Motor neurons are nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses from the spinal cord or brain (central nervous system) to muscle or glandular tissue. Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of all types of spinal muscular atrophy has been estimated to be 4-7.8 per 100,000 live births. Approximately 80% of SMA patients have the Werdnig-Hoffmann form.\n', 'Fibromuscular dysplasia, commonly called FMD, is a disease that causes one or more arteries in the body to have abnormal cell development in the artery wall. As a result, areas of narrowing (stenosis), aneurysms, or tears (dissection) may occur. If narrowing or a tear causes a decrease in blood flow through the artery, symptoms may result. FMD is most commonly found in the arteries that supply the kidneys with blood (renal arteries) and the arteries called the carotid and vertebral arteries which are found in the neck and supply the brain with blood. Less commonly, FMD affects the arteries in the abdomen (supplying the liver, spleen and intestines) and extremities (legs and arms). In more than one-half of people with this disease, there will be evidence of FMD in more than one artery. FMD affects women far more commonly than men, although men and children can be affected with this disease. In children with FMD, the disease seems to more commonly present with significant narrowing rather than tears of arteries and also seems to involve the arteries to the kidneys and intestines more commonly than the carotid vessels. In the pediatric population, FMD affects both boys and girls. The vascular subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV) has been associated with the most common type of fibromuscular dysplasia, known as multifocal FMD. This syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries in addition to the typical angiographic findings of fibromuscular dysplasia. There have been isolated reports of fibromuscular dysplasia associated with other disorders, including Alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Marfan syndrome, and moyamoya disease. (For more information on these disorders, search for the term in the Rare Disease Database.) In order to diagnosis FMD, a test must be done to image the blood vessels. There are many options for imaging the arteries, including specialized blood vessel ultrasound known as duplex ultrasound; a CAT scan of the arteries which is obtained after a dye is given through the veins, or a special type of MRI. In many cases, the diagnosis of FMD requires that a procedure known as an arteriogram be performed. Arteriography is a procedure that is performed by a radiologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular medicine specialist with appropriate training. It involves inserting a wire into or near the affected artery and injecting contrast material, a dye that can be detected by an X-ray machine. An X-ray of the affected area is then taken and examined. The individual is usually awake during an arteriogram procedure although medications may be given to keep her or him comfortable. This outpatient procedure usually lasts from one to two hours with a recovery period of up to six hours (this varies widely).\n', 'De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by the skin and eye symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) occurring in association with neurological abnormalities, mental retardation, unusually short stature (dwarfism), and underdevelopment of the testes or ovaries (hypogonadism). Xeroderma pigmentosum is a group of rare inherited skin disorders characterized by a heightened reaction to ultraviolet light (photosensitivity), skin discolorations, and the possible development of several types of eye disorders and skin cancers. The most common neurological abnormalities associated with De Sanctis- Cacchione syndrome are low intelligence, an abnormally small head (microcephaly), the loss of ability to coordinate voluntary movement (ataxia), and/or absent (areflexia) or weakened (hyporeflexia) reflexes. De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although about 200 cases have been reported in Western medical literature, the exact number of cases of this disorder is not known. Onset of symptoms usually occurs during the first year of life, but in rare cases may appear during early or late childhood. Onset of some neurological symptoms may occur as late as five to 10 years of age or even in the second decade of life. De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1932.\n', 'Japanese Encephalitis is a severe inflammation of the brain caused by the Japanese B Encephalitis Virus that is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes in certain areas of the world, particularly Asia. This disorder most commonly affects children and tends to be more actively spread during the summer. Symptoms include high fever, headaches, weakness, nausea, vomiting, paralysis, personality changes, and coma, possibly leading to neurological damage or death. Japanese Encephalitis is caused by the Japanese B Encephalitis Virus, an arbovirus (mediated via  insect bites), and transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.  Symptoms occur as the virus directly invades the central nervous system causing selective infection, destruction of nerve cells, and weakening of the immune system.\n', 'Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Medulloblastomas by definition occur in the cerebellum, which is the part of brain located at the base of the skull, just above the brainstem. The cerebellum is involved in many functions including coordination of voluntary movements (e.g., walking, fine motor skills) and regulating balance and posture. Medulloblastomas arise from primitive, undeveloped cells in the brain. Most medulloblastomas occur in infants and children. Less commonly, these tumors can develop in adults as well. Symptoms associated with a medulloblastoma include headaches in the morning that improve as the day goes on, recurrent vomiting and difficulty walking and with balance. Medulloblastomas can spread to other areas of the central nervous system. The exact cause of a medulloblastoma is unknown.\n', 'Infantile myofibromatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Some reports have noted that males are affected more often by the solitary form and females are affected more often by multicentric forms. The exact incidence is unknown, but is estimated to be between 1 in 150,000 to 400,000 live births. Because cases can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency in the general population is difficult. Although rare, infantile myofibromatosis is the most common fibrous tumor in infancy and early childhood.\n', 'Giant cell myocarditis is a rare cardiovascular disorder that occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). It is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium), a condition referred to as myocarditis. Inflammation is caused by widespread infiltration of giant cells associated with other inflammatory cells and heart muscle cell destruction. Giant cells are abnormal masses produced by the fusion of inflammatory cells called macrophages. Individuals with giant cell myocarditis may develop abnormal heartbeats, chest pain and, eventually, heart failure. Many individuals eventually require a heart transplant. The disorder most often occurs in young adults. Giant cell myocarditis affects males and females in equal numbers. It can affect individuals of any age although the majority of cases occur in young or middle-aged adults (median age 42 years). Approximately 300 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis is made by biopsy of heart tissue. A biopsy is a test in which small tissue sample is surgically removed and studied microscopically. Tests to exclude other cause of heart abnormalities may also be performed. These tests may include echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization.\n', 'Sneddon syndrome is a rare progressive disorder affecting small- and medium-sized blood vessels. The disorder is characterized by the association of a skin condition and neurological abnormalities. Characteristic findings include multiple episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia) causing mini-strokes or stroke and bluish net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin surrounding normal-appearing skin (livedo reticularis). Additional symptoms may include headache, dizziness, abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension), and heart disease. Lesions may develop within the central nervous system as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain, which can cause reduced intellectual ability, memory loss, personality changes, and/or other neurological symptoms. The combination of stroke symptoms and livedo reticularis differentiates this syndrome from other disorders. The exact cause of Sneddon syndrome is not fully understood. Sneddon syndrome has been reported more often in females than in males. Almost 80% of the patients are women with a median age of diagnosis at 40 years. Symptoms usually begin in early to middle adulthood, but can occur at any age including childhood. The incidence and prevalence are unknown. One estimate places the incidence at approximately one out of 250,000 individuals in the general population.\n', 'Keratomalacia is an eye (ocular) condition, usually affecting both eyes (bilateral), that results from severe deficiency of vitamin A. That deficiency may be dietary (i.e., intake) or metabolic (i.e., absorption). Vitamin A is essential for normal vision as well as proper bone growth, healthy skin, and protection of the mucous membranes of the digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts against infection. Keratomalacia occurs most commonly in developing countries due to prolonged dietary deprivation of vitamin A or protein-calorie malnutrition.  As noted above, keratomalacia is a major cause of blindness in young children in such areas.  In developed countries, vitamin A deficiency most frequently occurs when there is interference with vitamin A intake, absorption, or transport.\n', 'Smallpox is an infectious disease caused by the variola virus. It is characterized by fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), headaches and back pain. These initial symptoms are followed by a rash and small, raised bumps or lesions (pocks) within two or three days. Smallpox was a highly contagious disease, but was declared eradicated in 1980. However, recently smallpox has become of interest because of the possibility of its use as a weapon of warfare or of terrorism. There were two strains of smallpox, variola major and variola minor.\n', 'Weil syndrome, a rare infectious disorder, is a severe form of the bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria known as leptospirosis. Weil syndrome is characterized by dysfunction of the kidneys and liver, abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and/or alterations in consciousness. In most cases, Weil syndrome occurs among individuals who are exposed to affected animals. Weil syndrome is caused by an infection from the bacteria Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae or other related types of this bacteria (such as L canicola, or L pomona).  The infection is usually transferred to humans through urine or tissue of an infected domestic or wild animal.  The infection enters through a skin abrasion or the mucous membranes. Weil syndrome may occur in people of all ages.  At least 75% of persons infected with this disorder are male.  It can be an occupational disorder striking farmers, veterinarians, or sewer and abattoir workers, but most patients are exposed incidentally during recreational activities. The results of various laboratory tests, including blood and urine tests, assist in the diagnosis.\n', 'Formaldehyde Poisoning is a disorder brought about by breathing the fumes of formaldehyde. This can occur while working directly with formaldehyde, or using equipment cleaned with formaldehyde. Major symptoms may include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches; and/or skin rashes. Symptoms of Formaldehyde Poisoning are varied.  There may be eye irritation, breathing problems, skin irritations and headaches.  If formaldehyde is swallowed it causes burns to the esophagus and stomach.  Poisoning of patients using dialysis machines cleaned with formaldehyde can cause loss of red blood cells (acute hemolysis).  In extreme cases Formaldehyde Poisoning may include low blood pressure (hypotension), abnormalities of heart rhythm, irregular breathing, restlessness, unconsciousness and coma. Formaldehyde Poisoning may be caused in a variety of ways.  Some people are affected when they work with products made with formaldehyde such as chip board and foam insulation.  Persons may be poisoned by accidentally ingesting or swallowing formaldehyde.   Breathing the vapors given off by the chemical itself in plants that manufacture it, or by working in areas where formaldehyde is used to produce other products can also cause dangerous physical reactions to the chemical.  Poisoning may also occur when the chemical is being administered directly to a patient as formalin soaked packs for cysts.  A form of formaldehyde (Formalin) is sometimes used as a cleaning agent for dialysis machines and other hospital equipment, and it must be carefully and completely removed before the equipment can be used on patients in order to avoid Formaldehyde Poisoning. Formaldehyde Poisoning affects males and females in equal numbers.  People exposed in the workplace are most likely to be affected if they are not protected by appropriate air filtering equipment.\n', 'ATR-16 syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. More than 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Pitt-Hopkins syndrome affects both males and females and can affect individuals of any ethnic or racial background. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Approximately 500 affected individuals have been identified worldwide. Researchers believe that affected individuals often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency the disorder in the general population. Intellectual disability (due to all causes) affects approximately 1%-3% of the general population.\n', 'The overall incidence of lissencephaly is rare and estimated around 1.2/100,000 births.\n', 'Precocious puberty means an abnormally early onset of puberty. A sequence of events occurs during which a child develops into a young adult beginning at an unexpectedly early age. Glands that secrete growth and sex hormones begin to function abnormally early in life resulting in this condition. Often, the exact cause of precocious puberty is not known. Normal puberty begins with hypothalamic production of kisspeptin, which stimulates the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in the frequency and magnitude of gonadotropin release, especially LH. Unfortunately, it is challenging to determine the initial clinical corollary to these biochemical events. It has been suggested that there is a continuum of sexual development in girls from uncomplicated premature thelarche to true precocious puberty; the former being more likely to develop in girls under 2 years of age. This spectrum exists both clinically and biochemically and emphasizes the need for the clinician to distinguish between these conditions in patients when making decisions about treatment. The criteria for diagnosis and treatment of CPP need to be reached through a synthesis of clinical findings as well as laboratory evidence for activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The gold standard for determination of pubertal gonadotropin secretion is the GnRH stimulation test, though many clinicians start with a sensitive measurement of serum LH. Skeletal age determination is frequently obtained early in the work-up, and can be helpful in distinguishing isolated signs of puberty, which do not typically cause advancement in bone age as compared to true PP, which will advance bone maturity. In boys, serum DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OH progesterone and β-HCG levels are useful for the diagnosis of GIPP. In girls, serum DHEAS, estradiol and 17-OH progesterone levels are useful. Diagnostic studies including head MRI and pelvic ultrasound are frequently required in the work-up of children with PP.\n', 'STWS has a very low prevalence of <1 out of 1,000,000. However, the disease is relatively common in the United Arab Emirates with a prevalence of 1 out of 20,000 births, owing to the fact that parents are often closely related by blood (consanguineous). STWS affects males and females in equal numbers. Patients with STWS often go unrecognized making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population. STWS was first described in the medical literature in 1971.\n', 'Cogan type ocular motor apraxia affects males approximately twice as often as females.  Symptoms are present at birth (congenital).  The jerking-head movements associated with this disorder usually appear by the third or fourth month of life.  Approximately 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis of Cogan type ocular motor apraxia may be made upon observing the jerking-head movements that an infant will make in order to view an object to the side. Infants who exhibit jerking-head movements and the inability to fixate on an object should have a thorough eye examination by a qualified physician. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CT Scan, or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) may be used to determine whether any associated brain abnormalities (i.e., underdevelopment of the corpus callosum or improper development of the cerebellar vermis) are present.\n', 'Neonatal lupus is a rare condition that has occurred slightly more in female than male infants but is far less female gender dominant than systemic lupus erythematosus. Most symptoms of the disorder, except congenital heart block, are temporary (transient), usually resolving themselves within several months. The exact incidence is unknown, but congenital heart block is estimated to occur in 1 in 15,000 live births.  In general, the heart block associated with maternal autoantibodies occurs in the absence of any structural abnormalities of the heart. The diagnosis depends of course on the manifestation.  If during pregnancy, a fetal heart beat is found to be slow, then an echocardiogram is ordered. Echocardiography is an exam that uses reflected sound waves to create a picture of the heart and is required to assess the function of the heart and diagnose heart block. The mother should be immediately tested for anti-Ro and La antibodies. The diagnosis of the skin rash is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation. It may not always be necessary to test the infant for the antibodies as the mother’s blood test tells the story.\n', 'Cold urticaria is a chronic, reactive skin disorder. It is probably the most common form of physical urticaria (hives). Major symptoms may include abnormal reddening of the skin (erythema), hives and itching after exposure of the skin to cold temperatures. Cold urticaria affects males and females in equal numbers.  Essential cold urticaria makes up about 1% to 3% of all urticaria cases, and occurs most often among young adults.  Familial cold urticaria is rare.\n', 'X-linked ichthyosis is a genetic skin disorder that affects males. It is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid sulfatase. Under normal conditions, this enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) cholesterol sulfate, a member of the chemical family of steroids. Cholesterol sulfate plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the skin. If steroid metabolism is interrupted and cholesterol sulfate accumulates in the skin cells, the skin cells stick together more strongly than usual. The normal shedding of dead skin cells is inhibited and the skin cells build up and clump into scales. X-linked recessive disorders are conditions that are coded on the X chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.  Therefore, in females, the normal gene on one X chromosome can mask disease traits on the other X chromosome.  Since males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit the gene for a disease present on the X they will express the disease.  Men with X-linked disorders transmit the gene to all their daughters, who are carriers, but never to their sons.  Women who are carriers of an X-linked disorder have a 50 percent chance of transmitting the carrier condition to their daughters and a 50 percent risk of transmitting the disease to their sons. X-linked ichthyosis is a rare disorder affecting one in 6,000 males.\n', 'Achondrogenesis affect males and females in equal numbers. Achondrogenesis type IA and type IB are very rare disorders and prevalence for them is unknown. Achondrogenesis type II occurs in approximately 1/40,000-1/60,000 newborns.\n', 'Symptoms of Wieacker syndrome include stiffening of the muscles and joints of the feet (contracture), slowly progressive atrophy of certain muscles of the legs and arms, and mild intellectual disability. Other symptoms are impairment or inability to move the eyes despite the wish to do so, and impairment in the use of face and tongue muscles. In some cases, affected individuals may have droopy eyelids (ptosis), crossed eyes (strabismus), and farsightedness (hyperopia). Abnormal curvature of the spine may also occur (kyphoscoliosis). The prevalence of Wieacker syndrome is not known. Wieacker syndrome usually affects males, but some carrier females show mild manifestations of the disorder. As of 2015, the syndrome has been reported in 5 families. ZC4H2 gene mutations have also been identified in 3 sporadic patients who presented more or less severe intellectual disability and congenital contractures of multiple joints, at least equinovarus of the feet, associated with neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, spasticity, seizures and ptosis. In one of the families, those affected had neonatal respiratory distress responsible for early death. Wieacker syndrome is therefore now considered to be part of a wider phenotype consisting of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (congenital multiple joint contractures) and intellectual disability, caused by ZC4H2 gene mutations. In some instances in the history of the family in which the syndrome was first described, the syndrome was present at birth.\n', 'Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under the age of 1 year that remains unexplained after careful review of the history, death scene investigation, and thorough autopsy. In 2008, the most recent published data from the National Vital Statistics System indicated that SIDS was listed as the third leading cause of death in infants in the United States. Causes of SIDS are considered to be multifactorial. The triple risk hypothesis describes the presence of three risk factors that, when overlapping, predispose a baby to SIDS. These include an environmental trigger/stress, a critical developmental period, and an underlying vulnerability. Physician-scientists and scientists are studying neuropathological tissue and genetic material from SIDS victims to ascertain factors that might be responsible for heightening an infant’s vulnerability to SIDS. Others are performing physiologic studies on infants known to have an increased risk for SIDS. Basic scientists are studying animal models that might provide insight into mechanisms responsible for SIDS. Current clinical management targets improving education for families and caregivers regarding known modifiable environmental stressors (risk factors) (see below). There are typically no symptoms prior to a SIDS death. Though SIDS occurs during sleep, the deaths may occur during day or night time sleep. Existing literature does not indicate any evidence for suffering by the infant in the moments preceding the sudden death. SIDS can affect all infants under 1 year of age. Most deaths occur less than 6 months of age with the peak affected age between 2 and 4 months. Gender, ethnic and racial differences also exist. For example, boys are at greater risk for SIDS than girls. Also, the SIDS rate in African American infants is 2.7 times greater than the Caucasian rate in the US. Likewise, SIDS rates are increased in the American Indians and Alaskan natives as compared to Caucasians. These differences may reflect both cultural practices and genetic variations. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion which means that it is only determined as the cause of death after thorough investigation of clinical history, scene of death, and autopsy reveal no other cause.\n', 'Rieger syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by absent or under-developed (hypodontia or partial adontia) teeth, mild craniofacial abnormalities, and various abnormalities of the eye, especially glaucoma. If unaccompanied by other signs and symptoms, the eye abnormalities are referred to as Rieger eye anomalies. Rieger syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in about equal numbers.  The eye defects associated with this disorder can be detected during the first month of life. When the eye defects are not visible, diagnosis may be delayed until early childhood when the eye and dental defects become apparent. The disorder is commonly recognized by the presence of characteristic eye defects. In some cases these are delayed and diagnosis may be deferred until early childhood when the small, conical teeth become apparent.\n', 'FGFR2 The incidence of all types of Pfeiffer syndrome is approximately 1/100,000.\n', 'Warm antibody hemolytic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population. People of any age, including children, may develop warm antibody hemolytic anemia, but it is more common among adults with a peak incidence between 50-70 years.\n', 'Orocraniodigital syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by multiple malformations of the head and face (craniofacial area) and the fingers and toes (digits). Major characteristics may include a vertical groove in the upper lip (cleft lip) and/or the inside, upper portion of the mouth (cleft palate), an abnormally small head (microcephaly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), improper development (hypoplasia) of the thumbs and/or toes, and/or webbing (syndactyly) of the toes. In some cases, malformations of certain skeletal bones may also be present. Mental retardation has occurred in the majority of cases. Orocraniodigital syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Approximately 10 cases of orocraniodigital syndrome have been reported in the medical literature.  The symptoms are usually obvious at birth.\n', 'Kennedy disease affects fewer than 1 in 350,000 males and is very rare in females. Kennedy disease has been diagnosed in the USA, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. The Japanese population appears to have a very high prevalence of Kennedy Disease because of a founder effect.\n', 'The WAS-related disorders are a spectrum of conditions affecting the immune system that are caused by mutations in the WAS gene. These disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked congenital neutropenia. The WAS gene abnormality results in a deficiency in the WASP protein that leads to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  WAS-related disorders usually present in infancy and are characterized by bloody diarrhea, recurrent infections, scaling, itchy, skin rashes (eczema), and the appearance of small purple spots on the skin (petechia). The development of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and intracranial bleeding are possible early, life-threatening complications. Later potential complications include destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), arthritis, vasculitis and kidney and liver damage.  Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing lymphomas, especially after exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. WAS-related disorders are extremely variable, even in individuals in the same family. The estimated prevalence of WAS-related disorders is 3/1,000,000 males.  This condition has been described in many ethnic groups and in many countries. A WAS-related disorder is suspected based on clinical features and laboratory testing.  Testing shows a low platelet count and small platelet size, and sometimes shows abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins: low IgM, elevated IgA and IgE, decreased absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells and decreased function of natural killer cells. Decreased or absent WASP protein in blood cells strengthens the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing for the WAS gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.\n', 'Hirschsprung disease affects males 3 to 4 times more often than females, although long-segment HSCR has a gender ratio of 1:1. The disorder occurs in approximately one in 5,000 live births. It is usually apparent shortly after birth, but may present in older children and adults. Hirschsprung disease should be considered in people with a history of severe constipation.\n', 'Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the skeletal muscles, including muscle weakness and stiffness (myotonic myopathy); abnormal bone development (bone dysplasia); permanent bending or extension of certain joints in a fixed position (joint contractures); and/or growth delays resulting in abnormally short stature (dwarfism). Affected individuals may also have small, fixed facial features and various abnormalities of the eyes, some of which may cause impaired vision. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from person to person. Two types of the disorder have been identified that may be differentiated by age of onset and other factors. SJS type 1, which is considered the classical form of the disorder, may become apparent during early to late infancy or childhood. SJS type 2, a more rare form of the disorder, is typically recognized at birth (congenital). Most researchers now believe that SJS type 2 is actually the same disorder as Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome and not a form of SJS. (For more information on Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome see the Related Disorders section of this report.) SJS (SJS) types 1 and 2 are rare disorders that appear to affect males and females in equal numbers. More than 85 cases have been reported in the medical literature, including individuals affected by the classical (type 1) and the more severe neonatal form (type 2) of the disorder. SJS type 2 appears to be most common in individuals of United Arab Emirates descent. Depending upon the form of the disorder present, associated symptoms and findings may be recognized at birth or may become apparent during infancy or within the second year of life.\n', "Measles is a highly contagious viral disease occurring primarily in children. This disease is characterized by fever, cough, acute nasal mucous membrane discharge (coryza), inflammation of the lining of the eyelids (conjunctivitis), a spreading rash, and eruption of small, irregular, bright red spots (Koplik's spots) on the inner cheeks in the mouth with a minute bluish or white speck in the center of each. Measles is caused by a paramyxovirus.  The disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted from four days before the rash begins.  The virus lives in the mucus in the nose and throat of an infected person and is spread into the air when the infected person sneezes or coughs. Measles affects males and females equally and occurs worldwide.   As a result of vaccination to prevent measles, all cases that now occur in the United States have been brought from other countries.   Measles continues to be a significant public health problem in developing countries, with 30-40 million cases per year.  Most reported cases are from Africa. Measles is diagnosed by physical findings. This disease is characterized by fever, cough, acute nasal mucous membrane discharge (coryza), inflammation of the lining of the eyelids (conjunctivitis), a spreading rash, and eruption of small, irregular, bright red spots (Koplik's spots) on the inner cheeks in the mouth with a minute bluish or white speck in the center of each. Confirmation of measles virus infection can be done with a blood test called a measles virus sandwich-capture immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody assay. This test is most accurate if performed after the third day of rash up to one month after the beginning of rash.\n", 'Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell, are produced in the bone marrow and normally reside there. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body, especially the bone marrow. If only a single tumor is present, the term solitary plasmacytoma is used. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells, the term multiple myeloma is used. Plasma cells are a key component of the immune system and secrete a substance known as immunoglobulin proteins (M-proteins), a type of antibody. Antibodies are special proteins that the body produces to combat invading microorganisms, toxins, or other foreign substances. Overproduction of plasma cells in affected individuals results in abnormally high levels of these proteins within the body, referred to as M proteins. Major symptoms of multiple myeloma may include bone pain, especially in the back and the ribs; low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia) resulting in weakness, fatigue, and lack of color (pallor); and kidney (renal) abnormalities. Some affected individuals are more susceptible to bacterial infections such as pneumonia. The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown.\n', 'Since diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy usually begin before the age of 16, Wolfram syndrome is typically diagnosed in childhood to adolescence. However, onset of key symptoms or the genetic confirmation can come much later in some patients. Wolfram syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'Short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic defect in fatty acid catabolism belonging to a group of diseases known as fatty acid oxidation disorders (FOD). It occurs because of a deficiency of the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) enzyme. SCAD deficiency is thought to affect 1 in 40,000 to 100,000 newborns. In the US, ~10% of individuals have two copies of one of the common polymorphisms leading to potential identification of related metabolites in urine or blood.\n', 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) belong to a group of cancers known as soft tissue sarcomas. The number of new cases in the United States annually has been estimated to be 5,000-6,000. Tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. There are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). There are also case reports of tumors arising in the appendix and/or pancreas. These tumors most commonly present with abdominal pain, bleeding or signs of intestinal obstruction. They spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. Some GISTs are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. Most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, KIT or PDGFR, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. There are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). Most cases arise in older adults. Leiomyosarcomas of the intestinal tract arise in a similar location and can be confused with GIST. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. There are essentially two types of muscles in the body – voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles – the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. Smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. Smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. Leiomyosarcoma usually spreads via the bloodstream. It is very rare to see it in lymphatics. Since smooth muscle is found all over the body, a leiomyosarcoma can form almost anywhere where there are blood vessels, heart, liver, pancreas, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract, the space behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum), uterus, skin. The uterus is the most common location for a leiomyosarcoma. Most leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are now reclassified as GISTs. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown. (For more information on these tumors, choose “leiomyosarcoma” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Pentalogy of Cantrell is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). Pentalogy of Cantrell is characterized by a combination of birth defects. These birth defects can potentially involve the breastbone (sternum), the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen and aids in breathing (diaphragm), the thin membrane that lines the heart (pericardium), the abdominal wall, and the heart. Pentalogy of Cantrell occurs with varying degrees of severity, potentially causing severe, life-threatening complications. Most infants do not develop all of the potential defects, which may be referred to as incomplete pentalogy of Cantrell. When all five defects are present, this is referred to as complete pentalogy of Cantrell. The variability of the disorder from one individual to another can be significant. The exact cause of pentalogy of Cantrell is unknown. Most cases are believed to occur sporadically. The exact cause of pentalogy of Cantrell is unknown. Most cases occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). One theory suggests that the symptoms of pentalogy of Cantrell occur due to an abnormality in the development of midline embryonic tissue fourteen to eighteen days after conception. Several familial cases have been reported, and some researchers have suggested that genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder. More research is necessary to determine the exact, underlying cause(s) of pentalogy of Cantrell. Pentalogy of Cantrell affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact prevalence is unknown, but estimated to be 5.5 in 1 million live births. The symptoms of pentalogy of Cantrell are present at birth (congenital).\n', 'Rett syndrome occurs almost exclusively in girls. The incidence of Rett syndrome in the United States is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 girls by age 12. Cases of Rett syndrome can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. Rett syndrome is the second most common cause of severe intellectual disability after Down syndrome.\n', 'Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare form of cancer that affects the liver. Unlike most cancers of the liver, it occurs with greater frequency in adolescents and young adults who are otherwise healthy. There are often no symptoms or signs of the disorder for a long time. Symptoms that can develop include abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, and a general feeling of poor health (malaise). Treatment is usually through surgical removal (resection) of the tumor. When surgery is not possible or is unsuccessful, then other therapies may be considered. Recurrence following successful surgical removal of a tumor can occur, meaning that sometimes the tumor can come back after it was removed. The exact, underlying cause of this disorder is unknown. Fibrolamellar carcinoma is an ultra rare form of cancer. It affects both men and women and affects approximately 1 in 5,000,000 people in the general population.  Fibrolamellar carcinoma occurs with greater frequency among young adults with a median age of diagnosis of 25. It is found all over the world and the rate of occurrence can vary geographically. The disorder accounts for about 1% of all people with primary liver cancer in the United States, but accounts for about 5.8 percent of all people with primary liver cancer in Mexico.\n', 'Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle Cells There are essentially two types of muscles in the body - voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles - the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. Smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. Smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. Leiomyosarcomas affect both males and females. Leiomyosarcoma is a form of soft tissue sarcoma. According to the American Cancer Society, at least 15,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma occur each year in the U.S. Soft tissue sarcomas affect men and women equally and occur more often in adults than children or adolescents. Soft tissue sarcomas account for 1 percent of all adult cancers in the U.S. According to one estimate, leiomyosarcomas account for 7-11 percent of all cases of soft tissue sarcomas.\n', 'Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder caused by a missing piece (partial deletion or monosomy) of the short arm of chromosome 4. Major symptoms may include extremely wide-set eyes (ocular hypertelorism) with a broad or beaked nose, a small head (microcephaly), low-set malformed ears, growth deficiency, heart (cardiac) defects, intellectual disability, and seizures. The symptoms of this syndrome vary from person to person based the size and location of the missing piece of chromosome 4. WHS is an extremely rare disorder. Studies undertaken about 25 years ago suggested that the disorder occurred in approximately 1 in about 50,000 live births with a female to male ratio of 2:1. More recent studies suggest that the frequency of the disorder is underestimated because of misdiagnosis. A diagnosis of WHS may be suggested by the characteristic facial appearance, growth failure, developmental delays, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of a deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) by cytogenetic (chromosome) analysis.  Conventional cytogenetic analysis detects less than half of the deletions that cause WHS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a WHSCR probe has much better detection rate than standard karyotype and will detect most patients. However, the diagnostic test of choice is chromosomal microarray, which detects essentially all deletions of the WHSCR and defines the size of the deletion.  Chromosomal microarray can also find other chromosome rearrangements, such as extra pieces of other chromosomes that are seen in many patients with WHS.\n', "Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD-III), also called spinocerebellar ataxia type III, is a rare, inherited, ataxia (lack of muscular control) affecting the central nervous system and characterized by the slow degeneration of particular areas of the brain called the hindbrain. Patients with MJD may eventually become crippled and/or paralyzed but their intellect remains intact. The onset of symptoms of MJD varies from early teens to late adulthood. MJD is a rare inherited neurological disorder that disproportionately affects individuals of Portuguese descent, especially those from the Azores, an island colonized by Portuguese people.  MJD appears to affect slightly more males than females. While a family history and physical examination help in the diagnosis, the gold standard of diagnostic tests that detects 100% of the cases is the direct determination of the number of suspect CAG triplets in a patient's DNA. This may be readily done at a specialized genetic clinical laboratory.\n", 'Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare inflammatory lung disorder which was first described in the 1980’s as a unique disease entity composed of clinical symptoms such as flu-like illness in many individuals as well as cough and shortness of breath with exertional activities. Wheezing and hemoptysis are rare. The term bronchiolitis obliterans refers to swirls or plugs of fibrous, granulation tissue filling the small bronchiole airways. Organizing pneumonia refers to organized swirls of inflammatory tissue filling the small spherical units of the lungs referred to as alveoli and the alveolar ducts. Individuals with BOOP experience inflammation of the bronchioles and alveolar lung spherical units simultaneously, which distinguishes it from other similar inflammatory lung disorders. Though the term pneumonia is used, BOOP is not an infection. In most cases, the cause of BOOP is unknown and is referred to as idiopathic BOOP. Causes of BOOP include radiation therapy; exposure to certain fumes or chemicals, exposure to birds, post respiratory infections, after organ transplantation; and from more than 35 medications. Systemic disorders associated with BOOP include the connective-tissue diseases, immunological disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. BOOP has also been seen in association with lung abscess, lung cancer, and lymphoma. Importantly, the BOOP lesion is seen in individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and in these situations, the primary lung disease is the IPF and the secondary process is BOOP. BOOP affects males and females in equal numbers. It develops in individuals between 40-60 years old, but the disorder may affect individuals of any age. BOOP is estimated to account for 5 to 10% of the chronic infiltrative lung disease in the United States. BOOP has been reported throughout the world. A diagnosis of BOOP may be made based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as x-ray studies, especially a high-resolution chest computed tomography or HRCT, pulmonary function studies that includes a diffusing capacity test, and often a lung biopsy for microscopic tissue analysis. Lung biopsy may be via conventional transbronchial biopsy which frequently captures the diagnosis, transbronchial cryobiopsy which is newer and recovers a larger bit of tissue or in selected cases, open lung biopsy. The HRCT scan shows “ground glass” densities that are often triangular in shape with the base of the triangle along the chest wall and the airways can often be seen in the ground-glass opacities.\n', 'Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of certain muscles. Symptoms are usually limited to the shoulder blade area (scapula) and the smaller of the two leg muscle groups below the knee (peroneal). Facial muscles may be affected in a few cases. The leg symptoms often appear before the shoulder muscles become weakened. The rate of progression of the disorder varies from case to case. This condition can also occur in combination with other disorders. Scapuloperoneal myopathy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Scapuloperoneal myopathy affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms may begin in childhood or during adulthood. Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare disorder; the exact prevalence of this disorder in the general population is unknown.\n', 'There are numerous different infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, malignant neoplasms and skin conditions that can resemble the signs and symptoms of leishmaniasis.\n', 'Gilbert syndrome is diagnosed more often in males than females. The disorder affects approximately 3-7 percent of individuals in the general population. Gilbert syndrome affects individuals of all races. It is present at birth, but may remain undiagnosed until the late teens or early twenties. Gilbert syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1901. A diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome is often made when blood, drawn for routine health check up or another illness, such as an infection, detects mildly elevated bilirubin levels. Because the levels of bilirubin fluctuate, blood tests may not always show elevated bilirubin. Individuals are determined to have Gilbert syndrome by the presence of hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of hemolysis (premature breakdown of red blood cells) or structural liver damage.\n', 'Felty syndrome is usually described as associated with or a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. This disorder is generally defined by the presence of three conditions: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an enlarged spleen (spenomelgaly) and a low white blood cell count (neutropenia). The presence of RA gives rise to painful, stiff and swollen joints. A low white blood cell count, especially when accompanied by an abnormally large spleen, leads to a greater chance for infections. Other symptoms associated with Felty syndrome may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and/or discoloration of patches of skin (brown pigmentation). The exact cause of Felty syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be an autoimmune disorder that may be genetically transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis are affected by Felty syndrome.  This is a large number, but most of these go undiagnosed.  The disorder is about three times more common in women than in men.  Felty syndrome is not found as frequently among those of African descent as among Caucasian populations. The disorder generally affects persons 50 to 70 years of age. The differential diagnosis of Felty syndrome may include sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, reactions to certain drugs, and/or myeloproliferative disorders.  (For more information on these disorders, choose “Sarcoidosis” or “Amyloidosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Felty syndrome is usually diagnosed as a result of a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and the identification of the classic triad of physical findings (i.e. the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, low white blood count, and splenomegaly).\n', 'Glut1 deficiency syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence and prevalence of Glut1 deficiency syndrome in the general population is unknown. Because the disorder may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. Several hundred cases have been identified and described in the medical literature since 1991.\n', 'Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers. The disorder occurs worldwide. KTS is diagnosed based on physical signs and symptoms. Computed axial tomography (CAT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and color doppler studies may be useful in determining the extent of the condition and how best to manage it.\n', 'Acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Associated symptoms and findings may be variable, including among affected members of the same family (kindred). However, the disorder is typically characterized by underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (agenesis) of the thick band of nerve fibers joining the two hemispheres of the brain (corpus callosum) and moderate to severe mental retardation. In addition, many affected individuals have malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region and/or distinctive abnormalities of the fingers and toes (digits). Characteristic craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually large head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead, widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a small nose with a broad nasal bridge; and malformed (dysplastic) ears. Most affected individuals also have distinctive digital malformations, such as the presence of extra (supernumerary) fingers and toes (polydactyly) and webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain digits. Additional physical abnormalities may also be present, including growth retardation, resulting in short stature. Although autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested, acrocallosal syndrome often appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). Acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  The disorder was originally reported in 1979 (A. Schinzel).  Over 25 cases have been recorded in the medical literature.\n', 'KAT6A syndrome is believed to affect females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. According to the KAT6A Foundation, as of October 2018, there are 150 individuals known to have the disorder. Rare disorders like KAT6A syndrome often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. KAT6A syndrome is underdiagnosed and one estimate suggests that the disorder may account for as much as 1% of undiagnosed individuals with syndromic developmental delay.\n', 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple tumors arising from cells of specific neuroendocrine tissues. The endocrine system is the network of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream to reach their target organs along the entire body. These hormones regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the function of various organs and activities within the body. Hormones are involved in numerous vital and metabolic processes, including regulating heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure, as well as cell differentiation and growth. MEN type 1 affects males and females in equal numbers. It affects approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals. Some researchers believe that many cases of MEN type 1 go undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. The onset of the disorder can vary widely and it has been identified in children as young as 8 and adults as old as 80. MEN type 1 was first recognized as a genetic disorder in 1954.\n', 'Cerebellar agenesis appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. Congenital isolated cerebellar agenesis is considered an extremely rare occurrence. After birth (postnatally) the definite diagnosis of cerebellar agenesis is based on the neuroimaging findings with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); it cannot be made on clinical grounds. Before birth (prenatally) the diagnosis of cerebellar agenesis is not reliably possible, by ultrasound or fetal MRI. Babies are on record with normal brain ultrasound at 20-25 weeks of gestation, with subsequent destruction of the cerebellum during later stages of pregnancy.\n', 'Cervical teratomas are extremely rare germ cell tumors (neoplasm) that occur in the neck. The majority of teratomas occur in the testes or ovaries (gonads) or the lower back (sacrococcygeal region). In rare cases, other areas such as the neck may be affected. Most cervical tumors occur in children and are non-cancerous (benign). In extremely rare cases, cervical teratomas occur in adults and are usually cancerous (malignant). Cervical teratomas affect men and women in equal numbers. Germ cell tumors account for 3-5 percent of all tumors in childhood. Cervical teratomas are much more common in newborns than adults. Fewer than 50 cases of cervical teratomas in adults have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Infant respiratory distress syndrome is a lung disorder that tends to affect premature infants. Major symptoms include difficulty in breathing and collapsed lungs, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Infant  respiratory  distress syndrome is characterized by diminished oxygen intake in the premature newborn. A clear membrane is found lining the alveolar (air cell) ducts in the lungs and is associated with reduced amounts of lung wetting agents or emulsifier (surfactant).  The surfactant is a lipoprotein based on lecithin that stabilizes alveolar membranes.  When this surfactant is missing, breathing is difficult and may lead to collapse of a lung.  The affected infant must be placed on some type of ventilation, either mechanical or physical, in order to continue breathing. Infant respiratory distress syndrome affects male and female premature infants in equal numbers.  Among approximately 250,000 infants born prematurely each year in the United States, up to 50,000 will have IRDS which will kill approximately 5,000 of them.  Due in large part to the use of surfactants beginning in 1989, infant mortality rates in the United States have dropped from 9.7 per 1,000 births in 1989 to 8.9 per 1,000 births in 1991.  Infants with surfactant protein-B deficiency do not respond to surfactant replacement therapy.\n', 'Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) is a rare childhood brain tumor. In most cases, the tumor is a benign, slow growing tumor that usually does not spread to surrounding brain tissue. Symptoms of a JPA will vary depending upon the size and location of the tumor. Most symptoms result from increased pressure on the brain and include headaches, nausea, vomiting, balance problems and vision abnormalities. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas affect males and females in equal numbers. Most JPAs develop within the first two decades of life. JPAs are the most common cerebellar tumor in children. Astrocytomas as a whole are the most common brain tumor of childhood accounting for more than half of all primary childhood tumors of the central nervous system. The incidence rate is estimated at 14 new cases per million in children younger than 15 years of age. Most astrocytomas (approximately 80 percent) in children are low grade.\n', 'Juberg-Marsidi syndrome is an extremely rare X-linked genetic disorder that is fully expressed in males only, and is apparent at birth (congenital) or during the first few weeks of life (neonatal period). Affected children exhibit severe mental retardation; delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., crawling, walking, etc.); muscle weakness; diminished muscle tone (hypotonia); and/or delayed bone growth as well as growth retardation, resulting in short stature. Juberg-Marsidi syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygotes) may exhibit some of the symptoms associated with the disorder. Approximately six affected families (kindreds) have been reported in the medical literature. Most symptoms of Juberg-Marsidi syndrome may be apparent at birth or soon thereafter. Juberg-Marsidi syndrome may be diagnosed at birth or during early infancy, based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. Craniofacial abnormalities, low birth weight, genital malformations, and/or hearing impairment may be apparent at birth. Hearing impairment or deafness may be confirmed through a variety of specialized hearing (auditory) tests. Abnormalities in motor coordination, speech, and intellect may be monitored during infancy and childhood.\n', 'Mitochondrial diseases are one of the most common forms of metabolic disease. They are estimated to affect about 1 in 5,000 people in the general population of the United States. Within the mitochondrial diseases, PMM are very common but real epidemiological studies are not available yet. This is also because PMM often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed so determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult. These disorders affect both men and women, children and adults, and individuals of all ethnic and racial groups.\n', 'Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was identified as an epidemic in 1989 after three people in New Mexico were identified with the disorder. The exact incidence of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is unknown. One estimate indicates that anywhere from 5,000-10,000 people developed the disorder during the epidemic. Most reported individuals are females and from the United States. However, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been reported in other countries as well including Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n', 'Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a dominantly inherited disorder of skeletal muscle that predisposes susceptible individuals to a life threatening adverse reaction (fulminant MH event) upon exposure to potent volatile anesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, etc.) and the skeletal muscle relaxant succinylcholine. A fulminant MH episode is characterized by hypermetabolism that produces heat (hypethermia), increased oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide production, along with hyperkalemia, and acidosis with hyperlacactemia.  Skeletal muscle rigidity may either be localized to the masseter muscle or generalized.  Muscle damage is reflected by increases in serum creatine kinase, potassium, calcium, and phosphate.  Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and myoglobinemia often occurs.  The time of onset after induction of general anesthesia may vary from minutes to hours, and patients may have had previously uneventful exposure to anesthetics.\n', 'SPE affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of SPE in the general population is unknown. It is the most common form of eosinophilic lung disease. SPE can affect individuals of any age.\n', '"Moyamoya disease is a progressive disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain (cerebrovascular). It is characterized by the narrowing (stenosis) and/or closing (occlusion) of the carotid artery inside the skull, a major artery that delivers blood to the brain. At the same time, tiny blood vessels at the base of the brain open up in an apparent attempt to supply blood to the brain distal to the blockage. These tiny vessels are the ""moyamoya"" vessels for which the disease was named. Inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya. One of the symptoms is typically stroke, which results in paralysis of the face, arms or legs, loss of speech, etc., or temporary loss of neurologic function of body parts or speech (transient ischemic attacks, or “TIA”). Other symptoms that may result include headaches, visual disturbances, developmental delay, and seizures. Approximately 10% of cases of moyamoya in Asian countries have a genetic cause. Patients with this arteriopathy that occurs either on a familial or idiopathic basis are said to have moyamoya disease. Patients in whom the artery changes occur in association with another process such as sickle cell disease or Down syndrome are said to have moyamoya disease. In this report, we use the term ""moyamoya disease"" as shorthand for both forms. In Japan, moyamoya disease typically occurs in females under the age of 20. In Japan, the disease is estimated to occur in 1 per 300,000 people. Although moyamoya was originally reported in individuals of Japanese ancestry, cases have been reported from elsewhere in Asia as well as from Europe, North and South America, and most series reported in the western hemisphere have a minority of patients of Asian descent.  Of note, most patients in North America are isolated cases, with recent literature suggesting that less than 4% of cases in this population are familial. (Gaillard 2017) In most patients, the diagnosis of moyamoya can be made from a careful assessment of an MRI and MRA. Cerebral arteriography will confirm the diagnosis, establish the exact degree of blood vessel narrowing, demonstrate the existing blood flow patterns to various areas of the brain, and allow treatment decisions to be made; for these reasons, it is the standard diagnostic tool for this condition. In particular, catheter angiography can help with the identification of important blood vessels called “transdural collaterals,” which are present in some cases and can markedly influence surgical planning and prognosis. (Storey 2017)"\n', 'Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome can affect all ethnic groups (panethnic), but most cases have occurred in isolated populations in rural areas.\n', '"Papillitis, also known as optic neuritis, is characterized by inflammation and deterioration of the portion of the optic nerve known as the optic disk. Also referred to as the ""blind spot,"" the optic disk (optic papilla) is that portion of the optic nerve that enters the eye and joins with the nerve-rich membrane lining the eye (retina). The optic nerves are the pair of nerves (second cranial nerves) that transmit impulses from the retina to the brain. Individuals with papillitis experience loss of vision in one eye that may occur within several hours of onset. The severity of visual impairment may vary from case to case, ranging from slight visual deficiency to complete loss of light perception. In addition, affected individuals experience a reduction in color perception. In some cases, spontaneous recovery may occur. However, in other cases, permanent visual impairment may result if the underlying cause is not detected or treated. Papillitis may occur for unknown reasons, after a viral illness, or due to or in association with a number of different underlying disorders or other factors. Papillitis affects males and females in equal numbers and can occur at any age.  A percentage of people with papillitis may eventually be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  (for more information on this disorder, see the Related Disorders section of this report.) Diagnostic testing may include testing for visual acuity, testing for color vision, examination of the optic disc by means of ophthalmoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging."\n', 'A diagnosis of tularemia is made by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of tests that may include an attempt to isolate the bacteria from blood or body tissue or through specialized blood tests (serologic tests) that measure the body’s immune system response against the bacterium.\n', 'CBPS is a rare neurological disorder that was first recognized as a distinct syndrome in the early 1990s. The disorder is usually apparent at birth (congenital) or early in life, based upon characteristic physical findings and specialized imaging tests. In affected individuals who exhibit infantile spasms, onset of these sudden, involuntary contractions tends to occur within the first six months of life. Onset of other forms of epilepsy potentially associated with CBPS (e.g., atypical absence seizures, atonic-tonic seizures, and/or tonic-clonic seizures) may occur between two to 12 years of life. CBPS appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Various subtypes have been described based on radiological features as seen on MRI; the prevalence is now known.\xa0 In a recent review of 35 new cases of polymicrogyria, 22 had bilateral perisylvian distribution (Flotats-Bastardas et al 2012).\n', 'Femoral-Facial Syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs randomly (sporadically) in the population. There have been, however, two cases reported in which the disorder appeared to be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. The major symptoms of this disorder are underdeveloped thigh bones (femurs) and unusual facial features. Femoral-Facial Syndrome is a very rare disorder that seems to affect more males than females.  As of  1993, about 55 cases had been reported.  One-third of cases are associated with maternal diabetes.\n', 'Juvenile CLN3 disease affects males and females in equal numbers. In the United States, juvenile CLN3 disease along with the other forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, occurs in approximately three in 100,000 births. It can occur with greater frequency in families of Northern European Scandinavian ancestry; in particular, those of Swedish heritage. It is thought to occur in one in 25,000 infants in northern Europe. Juvenile CLN3 disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders affecting children.\n', 'Perniosis is an inflammatory disorder that is triggered by prolonged exposure to cold and damp (humid) conditions. It is a form of inflammation of the small blood vessels (vasculitis) and is characterized by painful, itchy, tender, skin lesions on the lower legs, hands, toes, feet, ears and face. The lesions usually last for two to three weeks. One form of the disorder affects the blood vessels of the thighs. The exact cause of perniosis is unclear.  Cold weather causes the small veins and arteries close to the skin to tighten or constrict.  When the tissues are rewarmed, blood leaks into the tissue and causes the skin to swell.  The swelling irritates the nerves, and pain is the result.  It is thought by some that the disorder may represent an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the cold.  Prolonged exposure to the cold, insufficient protective clothing, and circulatory or cardiovascular diseases may also be causative factors.  Some cases are believed to be caused by genetic factors.  Other suspected causes include nutrition, local infection, hormonal changes, and other systemic diseases. Perniosis is seen more often in females than in males.  Also, it is seen more often in women who are very thin.  Several articles in the medical literature focus on cases of perniosis in anorexic women.  Individuals with poor circulation and smokers are affected more frequently than the general population.  The disorder is more common in damp climates than in dry ones.  Symptoms usually begin before the age of 20 years. Diagnosis is the result of physical examination and the close examination of the process of rewarming.\n', 'Cystinosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000-200,000 people in the general population. Cystinosis has been reported worldwide, in all ethnic groups. Cystinosis is the most common cause of renal Fanconi syndrome in children and accounts for approximately 5 percent of all childhood cases of kidney failure.\n', 'FBN1 Marfan syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers and occurs worldwide with no ethnic predisposition. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1 in 5-10,000 individuals in the general population. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing mild cases of Marfan syndrome, the disorder is probably underdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population.\n', 'The exact incidence of macrocephaly-capillary malformation is unknown. Since its first description as a distinct entity in 1997, more than 140 affected individuals have been reported. Some patients may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of MCAP in the general population. Males and females appear to be affected in equal numbers.\n', 'Mulvihill-Smith syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by low birth weight; growth delays leading to short stature (dwarfism); and/or a prematurely aged facial appearance. Other findings may include additional abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) areas, multiple deeply-colored skin lesions (pigmented nevi), hearing impairment, and/or mental retardation. Eventually, some affected individuals may develop diminished capabilities to resist and fight off repeated infections (primary immunodeficiency). The range and severity of symptoms varies from case to case. All reported cases of Mulvihill-Smith syndrome have occurred as isolated cases.  It is possible that this condition is due to a new dominant gene mutation. Mulvihill-Smith syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers.  Most of the reported cases, however, have been males.  Only seven cases have been reported. The diagnosis of Mulvihill-Smith Syndrome may be suspected upon the identification of characteristic physical features and findings (e.g., low birth weight, lack of subcutaneous fat in the face, etc.). A diagnosis may be confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. For example, hearing tests may be performed to determine the range and severity of hearing impairment in each individual. Pigmented nevi may be present at birth (congenital) or shortly after birth. Other characteristic findings (e.g., short stature) may not be apparent until a child is older.\n', "Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impaired ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia) and disease of the peripheral nervous system (peripheral neuropathy). AVED is a progressive disorder that can affect many different systems of the body (multisystem disorder). Specific symptoms vary from case to case. In addition to neurological symptoms, affected individuals may experience eye abnormalities, disorders affecting the heart muscles (cardiomyopathy), and abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). AVED is extremely similar to a more common disorder known as Friedreich's ataxia. AVED is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. AVED affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is estimated to occur in fewer than 1 in 1 million people. In Tunisia, the disorder is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 people. The onset of AVED may occur during childhood or adulthood with cases reported in children as young as two and adults as old as 52. The disorder was first described in the medical literature in 1981. A diagnosis of AVED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of tests and characteristic findings (e.g. low levels of vitamin E with normal levels of lipoproteins and lipids and no evidence of fat malabsorption).\n", 'Bowen disease is a rare skin disorder. Affected individuals develop a slow-growing, reddish scaly patch or plaque on the skin. Sun exposed areas of the skin are most often affected. Bowen disease only affects the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). Lesions are usually not painful or may not be associated with any symptoms (asymptomatic). In most cases, treatment is highly successful. Bowen disease is considered a pre-cancerous condition, although the risk of developing skin cancer is less than 10 percent. The disorder usually affects older adults. The exact cause of Bowen disease is unknown, although there are identified risk factors such as chronic sun exposure. The exact incidence of Bowen disease in the general population is unknown. Bowen disease is most frequently diagnosed in Caucasian individuals over the age of 60, although can occur in individuals much younger. It is believed to occur more frequently in males than females.\n', 'Keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare, genetic, multi-system disorder. It is characterized by defects of the surface of the corneas (keratitis), red, rough thickened plaques of skin (erythrokeratoderma) and sensorineural deafness or severe hearing impairment. The skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and the nails may be affected. KID syndrome belongs to a group of skin disorders marked by dry, scaly skin known as the ichthyoses. KID syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. KID syndrome appears to affect females slightly more often than males. The disorder is very rare with fewer than 100 cases reported in the medical literature. Collectively, the ichthyoses affect more than 1,000,000 people in the United States.\n', 'Chromosome 15, Distal Trisomy 15q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder in which the end (distal) portion of the long arm (q) of the 15th chromosome (15q) appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. The disorder is characterized by growth delays before and/or after birth (prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation); mental retardation; and/or distinctive malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area. Additional abnormalities typically include an unusually short neck; malformations of the fingers and/or toes; abnormal sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and/or other skeletal malformations; genital abnormalities, particularly in affected males; and/or, in some cases, heart (cardiac) defects. The range and severity of symptoms and physical findings may vary from case to case, depending upon the length and location of the duplicated portion of chromosome 15q. In most cases, Chromosome 15, Distal Trisomy 15q is due to a chromosomal balanced translocation in one of the parents. Chromosome 15, Distal Trisomy 15q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that is thought to affect males approximately twice as often as females.  Since the disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1974 (A. Fujimoto), more than 30 cases have been reported in the literature.  The majority of symptoms and physical features associated with the disorder are apparent at birth. Other chromosomal disorders may be characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, mental retardation, distinctive craniofacial abnormalities, genital malformations, congenital heart defects, and/or other abnormalities similar to those potentially associated with Chromosome 15, Distal Trisomy 15q. Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome affects males and females in equal proportion. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. The prevalence of all forms of MPS is estimated to be from one in 43,261 to one in 1,505,160 births. However, because MPS disorders, especially milder forms, often go unrecognized, these disorders are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population.\n', "Pheochromocytoma is a rare type of tumor that arises from certain cells known as chromaffin cells, which produce hormones necessary for the body to function properly. Most pheochromocytomas originate in one of the two adrenal glands located above the kidneys in the back of the upper abdomen. Most chromaffin cells are found in the adrenal gland's inner layer, which is known as the adrenal medulla. Approximately 90 percent of pheochromocytomas occur in the adrenal medulla. Approximately 10 percent occur outside of this area. These cases are referred to as extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. Paragangliomas may be found in the chest, heart, bladder, and/or neck or base of the skull. Symptoms associated with pheochromocytomas include high blood pressure (hypertension), headaches, excessive sweating, and/or heart palpitations. In most cases, pheochromocytomas occur randomly, for unknown reasons (sporadically). In approximately 25 to 35 percent of cases, pheochromocytomas may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Some inherited cases may occur as part of a larger disorder such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2a and 2b, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis or familial paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3 or 4, or as familial isolated pheochromocytoma. Many different disorders and conditions share similar symptoms with pheochromocytomas especially neurogenic hypertension. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis. Thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, anxiety or panic attacks, hyperthyroidism, adrenal medullary hyperplasia, familial dysautonomia, and intracranial lesions may also have similar symptoms. Various tumors including neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas may mimic pheochromocytomas. Symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma may be induced by the use of certain medications. Withdrawal of the medication clonidine may cause similar symptoms.\n", 'Lenz Microphthalmia syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (unilateral or bilateral microphthalmos) and/or droopy eyelids (blepharoptosis), resulting in visual impairment. In rare cases, affected infants may exhibit complete absence of the eyes (anophthalmia). Most affected infants also exhibit developmental delay and mental retardation, ranging from mild to severe. Additional physical abnormalities are often associated with this disorder such as an unusually small head (microcephaly) and/or malformations of the teeth, ears, and/or fingers and/or toes (digits). The range and severity of findings may vary from case to case. Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is fully expressed in males only and is apparent at birth. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygous carriers) may exhibit some milder symptoms associated with the disorder. Approximately 12 affected males with the fully expressed disorder have been reported. The disorder was first described by Lenz  in 1955.\n', 'Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. It is often obvious at birth or shortly thereafter. There does not appear to be a higher risk for any particular ethnic or racial group. There are less than 500 cases of the disease on record. 85% of affected individuals progress to the accelerated phase.\n', 'Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder characterized by overproduction (proliferation) and accumulation of a specific type of white blood cell (histiocyte) in the lymph nodes of the body (lymphadenopathy), most often those of the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy). In some cases, abnormal accumulation of histiocytes may occur in other areas of the body besides the lymph nodes (extranodal). These areas include the skin, central nervous system, kidney, and digestive tract. The symptoms and physical findings associated with Rosai-Dorfman disease vary depending upon the specific areas of the body that are affected. The disorder predominantly affects children, adolescents or young adults. The exact cause of Rosai-Dorfman disease is unknown. Some studies suggest that Rosai-Dorfman disease affects males more often than females. The disorder can affected individuals of any age, but most often affects young adults under the age of 20. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease occurs more often in females in their 20s or 30s. More than 650 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder’s first description in the medical literature in 1969. The diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of specialized tests, such as surgical removal and microscopic examination of affected tissue (biopsy).\n', 'Bejel is an infectious disease that is rare in the United States but common in certain parts of the world. The infection is very similar to syphilis but is not sexually transmitted. Most frequently, transmission is by means of non-sexual skin contact or by common use of eating and drinking utensils. The organism that causes bejel belongs to the same family as the bacterium that causes syphilis, pinta and yaws and is known as treponema. Treponemas are spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochetes). Also known as endemic syphilis, bejel is characterized by lesions of the skin and bones that begin in the mouth and progress in gradual stages. The late stages are the most severe. Bejel is a rare infectious disease caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete), known as Treponema pallidum endemicum. Under a microscope, T. p. endemicum is virtually indistinguishable from Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The disease is not sexually transmitted. The diagnosis of bejel is based on the geographic history of the patient as well as laboratory testing of material from the lesions (darkfield examination). The responsible bacterium is readily identifiable on sight in a microscope as a treponema. Samples of the fluid that surrounds the lesions yield a positive VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption) test. However, additional history may be required to differentiate bejel from venereal syphilis.\n', "Hodgkin's disease is one of a group of cancers known as a lymphoma. Lymphoma is a general term used to describe cancers that affect the lymphatic system, especially the lymph nodes. Tumors often form in the lymph nodes (places where lymphatic vessels unite) and/or the area around the nodes. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss may occur along with swollen lymph nodes. The exact cause of Hodgkin's disease is unknown.\n", 'An astrocytoma is a tumor that arises from the star-shaped cells (astrocytes) that form the supportive tissue of the brain. Other supportive cells of the brain include oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. Collectively, these cells are known as glial cells and the tissue they form is known as glial tissue. Tumors that arise from the glial tissue, including astrocytomas, are collectively referred to as gliomas. Grade I astrocytoma occurs most often in children and teens and account for 2% of all brain tumors. Grade II astrocytoma occurs most often in adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Grade III astrocytoma occurs most often in adults between the ages of 30 and 60, is more common in men and accounts for 4% of all brain tumors. Grade IV astrocytoma occurs most often in adults between the ages of 50 and 80, is more common in men and accounts for 23% of all primary brain tumors. The diagnosis of astrocytoma is based on a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, a careful patient history, and specialized tests, such as blood tests, neuroimaging techniques, and/or other diagnostic studies. Neuroimaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain assist in evaluating tumor size, location, and other factors. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. MRI uses a magnetic field to create cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. Examination of a sample of the tumor (biopsy) and microscopic examination of tumor cells is used to determine the tumor type and grade.\n', 'The diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei may be confirmed by radiologic technologies such as abdominal CT scan or abdominal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). These imaging tests may reveal the characteristic distribution of large amounts of mucus to particular locations within the abdomen and pelvis. They may also localize a primary tumor in the area of the appendix referred to as a mucocele. The goal of the treatment of pseudomyxoma peritonei is cure. This is achieved in approximately 65% of patients. The treatments are cytoreductive surgery with peritonectomy in an attempt to remove all visible evidence of the disease from the abdomen and pelvis. Because the mucinous tumor is so widely distributed throughout the abdomen and pelvis, the surgery may take up to 12 hours. Then, to prevent reimplantation of cancer cells, the abdomen is washed with a warm chemotherapy solution. This is commonly referred to hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or HIPEC. Sometimes the surgeon must search carefully for the primary appendiceal tumor for it may be very small in comparison to the mucinous tumor and mucinous ascites that can accumulate in kilogram quantities within the abdomen and pelvis. The hyperthermic intraperitoneal drugs which are commonly used to treat this disease include mitomycin C and oxaliplatin. The chemotherapy is heated to 42 degrees in the abdominal cavity to increase penetration of the drugs into the mucinous tumor and to increase the local cytotoxicity.\n', 'Chromosome 9, Partial Monosomy 9p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which there is deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the 9th chromosome. Characteristic symptoms and findings include mental retardation; distinctive malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, such as an abnormally shaped forehead (i.e., trigonocephaly), upwardly slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and unusually flat midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia); structural malformations of the heart (congenital heart defects); genital defects in affected males and females; and/or additional physical abnormalities. In most cases, Chromosome 9, Partial Monosomy 9p appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). In observed cases, Chromosome 9, Partial Monosomy 9p has appeared to affect females more frequently than males.  Since the disorder was originally described, more than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Acquired agranulocytosis is a rare, drug-induced blood disorder that is characterized by a severe reduction in the number of white blood cells (granulocytes) in the circulating blood. The name granulocyte refers to grain-like bodies within the cell. Granulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Acquired Agranulocytosis is a rare blood disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  People who are taking certain medications such as cancer drugs, alkylating agents, anti-thyroid drugs, dibenzepin compounds, or other drugs can be at risk for this disorder. The diagnosis of acquired agranulocytosis is made by combining a thorough history with tests to confirm abnormally low levels of granulocytes in the circulating blood. Regular periodic blood testing is required for individuals who take drugs that place them at high risk for acquired agranulocytosis. In some cases (e.g., people who are taking clozapine), blood tests to monitor granulocyte levels are done on a weekly basis.\n', 'X-liked hyper IgM syndrome is estimated to affect about 2 in 1,000,000 newborn boys. The autosomal recessive forms of hyper IgM syndrome are extremely rare. Hyper IgM syndrome type 2 is estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 people in the general population. The other forms of hyper IgM syndrome have only been described in the medical literature in a very small number of people. Because rare disorders often go undiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult. The X-linked form predominately affects males; the autosomal recessive forms affect both males and females. X-linked hyper IgM syndrome accounts for about 70% of people with this disorder.\n', '"Sennetsu Fever is a rare infectious disease belonging to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses. These diseases are caused by bacteria belonging to the ""Ehrlichia"" family. Several forms of Human Ehrlichial infection have been identified including Sennetsu Fever, Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME), and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE). Though caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, the disorders are all characterized by similar symptoms."\n', "Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24) is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder in which an individual's biological clock fails to synchronize to a 24-hour day. Instead of sleeping at roughly the same time every day, someone with N24 will typically find their sleep time gradually delaying by minutes to hours every day. They will sleep at later and later clock times until their sleep periods go all the way around the clock. (In extremely rare cases the sleep rhythm will gradually advance rather than delay.) Patients' cycles of body temperature and hormone rhythms also follow a non-24-hour rhythm. Attempts to fight against this internal rhythm and sleep on a typical schedule result in severe and cumulative sleep deprivation. N24 occurs in 55-70% of completely blind people, but also occurs in an unknown number of sighted people.\n", "Alopecia areata is a disorder characterized by loss of hair. Sometimes, this means simply a few bare patches on the scalp. In other cases, hair loss is more extensive. Although the exact cause is not known, this is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system, the body's own defense system, mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, the tiny structures from which hairs grow. Unpredictable hair loss is the only noticeable symptom of this disorder. Regrowth of hair may or may not occur.  Hair loss is usually confined to the head and face, although the entire body may be involved. Alopecia areata affects males and females in equal numbers.  It may appear at any age, but most typically begins during childhood.  There are approximately 2.5 million individuals in the United States affected by alopecia areata.\n", 'Yunis-Varon syndrome is a rare genetic multisystem disorder with defects affecting mostly the skeletal system, the nervous system, and ectodermal tissue (hair and teeth). It is characterized by large fontanelles, clavicular hypoplasia, characteristic facial features and/or abnormalities of fingers and toes. Characteristic features may include microcephaly, ear abnormalities, anteverted nares, midfacial hypoplasia, tented upper lip and small jaw (micrognathia), sparse or absent eyebrows and/or eyelashes. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes may include absence (aplasia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the fingers and toes. Most infants with this disorder experience severe feeding problems and respiratory difficulties. Some of these difficulties are related to the severe involvement of the central nervous system, with malformations of the brain affecting half of the children and hypotonia (low tone) affecting all of them. In addition, affected infants may have heart defects (e.g., abnormal enlargement of the heart muscle [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]). Frequently, feeding problems, respiratory difficulties, and/or heart defects may result in life-threatening complications during infancy. Yunis-Varon syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Yunis-Varon syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. 25 cases from 19 families have been reported since the disorder’s initial description in the medical literature in 1980.\n', "Thyroid cancer (carcinoma) is cancer affecting the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped structure located at the base of the neck. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system, the network of glands that secrete hormones that regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the body's activities as well as regulating the heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 64,300 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Of those cases, more than 49,350 will occur in women. In fact, thyroid cancer is now the 5th most common cancer in women. Thyroid cancer can affect individuals of any age and specific forms occur with greater frequency among different age groups. In general, thyroid nodules in children and adolescents are more likely may be malignant than those that occur in adults. In general, for unclear reasons, the rate of thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Some researchers believe that this increase in frequency is due to the greater use of imaging (CT scans, MRI), with the result being an increase in the rate of detection of small thyroid cancers that may not ever have been detected while the individual was alive. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 is a rare genetic cancer syndrome in which tumors develop in the endocrine glands (e.g., thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands). Two main subtypes exist called MEN 2A and MEN 2B. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is considered a third subtype. Nearly all individuals with MEN 2 develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) at some point. (For more information on these disorders, choose “multiple endocrine neoplasia” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n", 'Dercum’s disease affects females more often than males with some reports citing the disease is as 20 times more common in women. Dercum’s disease can affect individuals of any age. The majority of cases are women between the ages of 45-60, especially overweight, postmenopausal women. Although an extremely rare occurrence, it has been reported in children. The prevalence of Dercum’s disease is unknown. The disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Dercum’s disease was first described in the medical literature in 1882 by an American neurologist named Francis Xavier Dercum’s. A diagnosis of Dercum’s disease is suspected based on a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic multiple fatty growths. Surgical removal and microscopic study (biopsy) of affect tissue confirms that these growths are lipomas.\n', 'Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of iron in various organs of the body. Symptoms usually become apparent before the age of 30. The specific symptoms and severity of juvenile hemochromatosis vary from one person to another. Common symptoms include absent or decreased function of the testes in males or ovaries in females (hypotrophic hypogonadism), heart (cardiac) disease, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), joint disease, diabetes, and dark discoloration of patches of skin (hyperpigmentation). These symptoms are similar to those seen in classic hereditary hemochromatosis. However, the symptoms associated with juvenile hemochromatosis occur at an early age and are usually more severe. If untreated, juvenile hemochromatosis can potentially cause life-threatening complications. Juvenile hemochromatosis is caused by mutations of one of at least two genes (the HJV and HAMP genes). These mutations are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Juvenile hemochromatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is rare, but the actual incidence in the general population is unknown. Juvenile hemochromatosis has been reported worldwide. The disorder usually becomes apparent between 10-30 years of age. Mutations of the HJV gene account for the majority of cases of juvenile hemochromatosis.\n', 'Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a rare heart condition that affects infants and children. Specifically, cardiomyopathy means disease of the heart muscle (myocardium). Several different types of cardiomyopathy exist and the specific symptoms vary from person to person. In some affected individuals, no symptoms may be present (asymptomatic); in many people, cardiomyopathy is a progressive condition that may result in an impaired ability of the heart to pump blood; fatigue; heart block; irregular or rapid heartbeats (tachycardia); and, potentially, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.\n', 'Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder resulting from the deficient function of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen lll cosynthase (UROS), the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Due to the impaired function of this enzyme, excessive amounts of particular porphyrins accumulate, particularly in the bone marrow, plasma, red blood cells, urine, teeth, and bones. The major symptom of this disorder is hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight and some types of artificial light, such as fluorescent lights (photosensitivity). After exposure to light, the photo-activated porphyrins in the skin cause bullae (blistering) and the fluid-filled sacs rupture, and the lesions often get infected. These infected lesions can lead to scarring, bone loss, and deformities. The hands, arms, and face are the most commonly affected areas. CEP is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Typically, there is no family history of the disease. Neither parent has symptoms of CEP, but each carries a defective gene that they can pass to their children. Affected offspring have two copies of the defective gene, one inherited from each parent. CEP is a very rare genetic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Over 200 cases have been reported worldwide.\n', "Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) has been defined as the absence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal facing toward the dura of the middle cranial fossa. SSCD has been implicated as the cause of a variety of inner ear symptoms including Tullio's phenomenon, pressure induced vertigo, aural fullness, autophony, conductive hearing loss, and fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, SSCD has also been reported to be asymptomatic. In the past, many patients with SSCD had been misdiagnosed as having otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tubes, middle ear perilymphatic fistulas, or Ménière’s disease. Identification of this entity requires a high degree of suspicion, appropriate findings on physical exam, lab testing, and confirmation on high-resolution CT scan. Surgical repair of the SSCD or occlusion of the superior canal has been reported with a high degree of symptom resolution. SSCD has been labelled the “great otologic mimicker” because it can simulate the symptoms of so many other ear disorders. However, the most common symptoms are vertigo/dizziness elicited by pressure altering activity, Tullio’s phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo), fullness/pressure in the ear and autophony.  Autophony is hearing internal noises louder than would be expected, such as hearing your eyes move/blink, heart beat or joint movements. Hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss can occur, mimicking otosclerosis or Meniere’s disease. Fullness in the ear and hearing your breathing loudly in the ear are symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, but can also be found with SSCD.  Finally, most patients with the anatomic defect of superior semicircular canal dehiscence have no symptoms at all for some time prior to developing symptoms. SSCD can affect all age groups. There are no studies looking at the demographics of SSCD, however, the vast majority of patients diagnosed with SSCD are adults. Although the incidence of finding SSCD on a scan is the same for adults and children, the incidence of symptomatic SSCD in children is much less. Dehiscence of bone in other parts of the otic capsule can produce similar syndromes, although they are much less common. Other locations include the posterior semicircular canal, the horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea. Posterior semicircular canal dehiscence is often due to a high riding jugular bulb but can also been seen with anomalies of the vestibular aqueduct, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS). EVAS, by itself can also produce symptoms similar to SSCD. Horizontal semicircular canal dehiscence is most frequently the result of an eroding process such as cholesteatoma. The cochlea can have bony dehiscence where it abuts the carotid artery and at the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. Lastly, the bony opening where the hearing nerve enters the cochlea (at the internal auditory canal) can be abnormally wide, resulting in symptoms similar to SSCD. Because the condition of SSCD is still fairly new (identified in 1998), it could be argued that all treatments are considered experimental or investigational.  However, the most frequently employed are surgical. Surgery for SSCD has included resurfacing the defect with a variety of materials, plugging the superior semicircular canal, and a combination of resurfacing and plugging. These techniques can be done through a transmastoid or a middle fossa craniotomy approach. These techniques have found great success in reducing or eliminating the vestibular symptoms of SSCD. These techniques are also effective in reducing or eliminating autophony but they have not been effective in improving hearing. A lesser approach that seems to give similar benefits is reinforcement of the middle ear windows. This surgery has the advantage of being a more minimally invasive procedure but the success rate seems to be much lower with a higher recurrence rate in the long term.\n", 'Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mental retardation; abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area; large, soft hands with short, thin (tapered) fingers; short stature; and/or various skeletal abnormalities. Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jawbone (maxillary hypoplasia), an abnormally prominent brow, downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large ears, and/or unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) and unusual prominence of the breastbone (sternum) (pectus carinatum). Coffin-Lowry syndrome is caused by mutations in the RSK2 gene and is inherited as an X-linked dominant genetic trait. Males are usually more severely affected than females. Coffin-Lowry syndrome affects as many males as females.  However, symptoms may be more severe in males.\n', 'Oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFDS) is an umbrella term for at least 10 apparently distinctive genetic disorders that are characterized by defects and flaws in the development of the structure of the oral cavity including the mouth, tongue, teeth, and jaw; the development of the facial structures including the head, eyes, and nose; and the fingers and toes (digits); along with differing degrees of mental retardation. The presentation of signs and symptoms is extremely varied, making diagnosis difficult. OFDS type I is the most common of all of these disorders, and it is quite rare. Each of the other types is extremely rare. All types of oral-facial-digital syndrome are rare, with type I being the least rare. The incidence of OFDS type I is thought to be between 1 per 50,000 births and 1 per 250,000 births. Diagnosis of OFD syndrome type I when suspected, may be confirmed by genetic testing. There are no specific tests at the present time for any of the other types. However, diagnosis is generally made on the basis of the clinical symptoms presented.\n', 'In 2017, more than 22,400 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the United States. It affects about 1 in 70 women in the U.S and is the second most common gynecological cancer behind only endometrial cancer. The average age at diagnosis is 63. Worldwide about 240,000 women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer. The incidence, which is the number of people with a disease over a given period of time such as one year, is greater in developed countries.\n', 'A diagnosis of OPMD is suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. A diagnosis is confirmed through commercially available blood tests that can detect the specific genetic abnormality associated with OPMD (i.e., mutation of the PABPN1 gene).\n', 'PCT is a rare disorder that affects males and females. The disorder usually develops after the age of 30 and its onset in childhood is rare. PCT is found worldwide and in individuals of all races. The prevalence is estimated to be approximately 1 in 10,000 to 25,000 individuals in the general population. PCT is the most common form of porphyria.\n', 'Toxic Shock Syndrome is a rare multisystem disease with many widespread symptoms. It is caused by a toxin that is produced and secreted by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome may include a sudden high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension), and a characteristic skin rash that resemble a bad sunburn. Most cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome occur in menstruating females in association with the use of tampons. Other cases may occur in association with postoperative wound infections, nasal packing, or other factors. The diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control clinical and laboratory criteria. TSS is considered probable if three or more criteria are met in association with peeling (desquamation) of affected skin or if five or more criteria are met in the absence of desquamation. The criteria include the following: fever; rash, with possible, subsequent peeling (desquamation), particularly on the palms and soles; low blood pressure (hypotension); the involvement of three or more organ systems (i.e., digestive [gastrointestinal], muscular, mucous membranes, kidneys, liver, blood, and/or brain and spinal cord [central nervous system]). and negative results of blood tests for the infectious diseases Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Leptospirosis, and Measles.  Sometimes S. aureus may be isolated from the vagina or from localized (focal) wound sites and identified with the use of various laboratory techniques (e.g., bacterial cultures).\n', '"Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by multiple contractures (i.e., restricted movement around two or more body areas) at birth (congenital), abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial) area, defects of the hands and feet, and skeletal malformations. Craniofacial abnormalities may consist of characteristic facial features that cause the individual to appear to be whistling. These features include an extremely small puckered mouth (microstomia); a ""full"" forehead appearance, unusually prominent cheeks; and thin, pursed lips. Affected infants may also have an unusually flat middle portion of the face, a high roof of the mouth (palate), an unusually small jaw (micrognathia), an abnormally small tongue (microglossia), and/or a raised, scar-like mark in the shape of an ""H"" or a ""V"" extending from the lower lip to the chin. Affected infants often have abnormalities affecting the eyes including widely-spaced deep-set eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Malformations of the hands and feet are also characteristic of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Children with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome may also exhibit speech impairment; swallowing and eating difficulties; vomiting; failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and/or respiratory problems that may result in life-threatening complications. Freeman-Sheldon syndrome can be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. However, most cases occur randomly with no apparent cause (sporadically). Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was first described in 1938 by Drs. Freeman and Sheldon. Some cases occurred within families (kindreds) over several generations. Some symptoms and physical findings associated with the disorder are apparent at birth (congenital). Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is one of a group of disorders that are associated with multiple congenital contractures (MCCs). MCCs occur in approximately 1 in 3,000 children. Because the disorder shares features with other congenital contracture syndromes it sometimes is misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population."\n', 'Cytochrome C Oxidase deficiency is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme cytochrome C oxidase (COX), or Complex IV, an essential enzyme that is active in the subcellular structures that help to regulate energy production (mitochondria). Deficiency of COX may be limited (localized) to the tissues of the skeletal muscles or may affect several tissues, such as the heart, kidney, liver, brain, and/or connective tissue (fibroblasts); in other cases, the COX deficiency may be generalized (systemic). Four distinct forms of Cytochrome C Oxidase deficiency have been identifed. The first form of this disorder is known as COX deficiency, benign infantile mitochondrial myopathy. Affected infants exhibit many of the same symptoms as those with the more severe infantile form of the disease; however, because the COX deficiency is limited (localized) to tissues of the skeletal muscles, they typically do not have heart or kidney dysfunction.\n', 'The symptoms, progression and severity of SRS does not appear to vary from patient to patient. Affected children have a “gestalt” consisting of facial dysmorphism with a prominent lower lip, an asthenic build, low muscle mass, kyphoscohosis and speech abnormalities. Males with SRS have low muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth. Symptoms appear early, especially the facial features. Developmental milestones are also not met early in life. The developmental delay progresses such that many boys with SRS have some motor disability. Osteoporosis develops which can result in numerous fractures without a causative event. Seizures are not common and severity varies. Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare X-linked intellectual disability disorder and as such it is difficult to estimate its prevalence. As SRS has been identified in patients located in the United States, South America and Europe, it is likely not restricted to any ethnic population geographical locale. Many XLID disorders present with hypotonia very early in life. However, SRS is the only human disorder related to an abnormality in polyamine biosynthesis.\n', 'Although retinoblastoma is a rare disorder, it is the most common cancer of the eye in children, accounting for about 3% of all childhood malignancies. Retinoblastoma affects males slightly more often than females. The incidence in the United States and Europe is estimated to be 2-5 children per 1,000,000 people in the general population. The age-adjusted annual incidence for children aged 0-4 in the United States is 10-14 children per 1,000,000. This equates to about 1 in 14,000-18,000 live births. Incidence is the number of newly diagnosed people with a disorder identified in a given year. Two-thirds of children are affected before the age of 2 and more than 90% of retinoblastomas become apparent before the age of five years. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, the identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. The presenting symptom is usually leukocoria. A complete examination of the interior of the eye (fundoscopic examination under anesthesia – EUA) may be performed to locate the presence of a tumor or tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) may be used to determine the extent of the tumor(s) and determine if the tumor has spread to surrounding structures or tissue. Ultrasonography may be used to rule out other conditions. Computed tomography (CT) scans are generally avoided because of the potential risk of additional radiation-induced tumors if the child has hereditary retinoblastoma.\n', '"Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare multi-system disorder characterized by widespread inflammation, weakening, and damage to small and medium-sized arteries. Blood vessels in any organ or organ system may be affected, including those supplying the kidneys, heart, intestine, nervous system, and/or skeletal muscles. Damage to affected arteries may result in abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension), ""ballooning"" (aneurysm) of an arterial wall, the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), obstruction of blood supply to certain tissues, and/or tissue damage and loss (necrosis) in certain affected areas. Polyarteritis nodosa mainly affects small and medium-sized arteries.  Blood vessels in any organ or organ system may be affected, including arteries supplying the kidneys, heart, intestine, nervous system, and/or skeletal muscles.  Damage to affected arteries may result in abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension), “ballooning” (aneurysm) of an arterial wall, the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), obstruction of blood supply to certain tissues, and/or tissue damage and loss (necrosis) in certain affected areas. Joint, muscle, abdominal and testicular pain may occur.  The small and medium-sized arteries of the kidneys are most often involved.  The lungs are much less commonly affected. Polyarteritis nodosa usually affects people between 40 and 50 years of age, but it may occur in any age group.  It affects approximately 1 in 100,000 people. Men appear to be affected two to three times more often than women. Since there are no blood or other chemical tests to indicate the presence of this disorder, the diagnosis is based upon physical examination and the exclusion of other likely candidates for diagnosis. In suspected cases, biopsy of the blood vessel wall (lumen) is necessary to confirm the presence of the typical lesions. Biopsies of the kidney or liver may also be required."\n', 'Fabry disease is a rare pan-ethnic disorder, meaning that it occurs in all racial and ethnic populations affecting males and females. It is estimated that type 1 classic Fabry disease affects approximately one in 40,000 males. The type 2 later-onset phenotype is more frequent, than the type 1 phenotype by 3-10 fold, and in some populations may occur as frequently as about 1 in 1,500 to 4,000 males (Spada 2006, Hwu 2009, Chien 2012). Data emerging from the newborn screening studies suggests that the incidence of Fabry disease varies in different geographic regions (Spada 2006, Hwu 2009, Burlina 2018, Wasserstein 2019).  Already, newborn screening for Fabry disease has been initiated in several states in the USA.\n', "Krabbe's Leukodystrophy is a rare inherited lipid storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC), which is necessary for the breakdown (metabolism) of the sphingolipids galactosylceremide and psychosine. Failure to break down these sphingolipids results in degeneration of the myelin sheath surrounding nerves in the brain (demyelination). Characteristic globoid cells appear in affected areas of the brain. This metabolic disorder is characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction such as mental retardation, paralysis, blindness, deafness and paralysis of certain facial muscles (pseudobulbar palsy). Krabbe's Leukodystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. About 1 in 40,000 newborn babies in the United States is affected with Krabbe’s Leukodystrophy.  Males are affected as often as females. Krabbe's Leukodystrophy can be diagnosed by testing the activity of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (galactosylceramidase) in fibroblast cells obtained from an infant or from a fetus by amniocentesis.\n", "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II, also known as Schmidt syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disorder in which there is a steep drop in production of several essential hormones by the glands that secrete these hormones. When first described, this disorder was thought to involve only adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and thyroid insufficiency (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). However, over time, as more patients were studied, the scope of the disorder was expanded to include disorders of other underperforming endocrine glands. These include the gonads, which secrete sex hormones; the pancreas which secretes insulin and is intimately tied up with diabetes mellitus; and sometimes the parathyroid glands. Failure of the endocrine glands to function is usually accompanied by signs of malnutrition because the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb nutrients is reduced dramatically.  Since the combination of affected glands differs from patient to patient, the signs of this disorder are diverse. The exact cause of AIPS-II is not known, but it is thought to result from one or more abnormal immune responses.  Autoimmune reactions occur when, for reasons not quite clear, the body mistakenly reacts to a normal antibody as if it were a foreign one. Report suggest that the prevalence of AIPS-II is about 14 to 20 cases per million of population and that it affects females 3 to 4 times as often as it does males.  AIPS-II usually strikes in the third or fourth decade of life. Each disorder in a case of autoimmune polyendocrine type II is treated separately. For many of the specific disorders, treatment is focused on hormone replacement therapy.\n", 'Factor XI deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder can affect individuals of any age and any ethnic group. It is the second most common bleeding disorder to affect women (after von Willebrand disease). The incidence of factor XI deficiency is higher in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent where it is estimated to affect 8% of the population. The severe form of the disorder is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people in the general population.\n', 'When the cause of MDS is unknown it is called idiopathic MDS. A so-called secondary MDS can develop after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer or autoimmune diseases It is possible that some chemicals (pesticides and benzene), cigarette smoking, and possibly viral infections can predispose to MDS. However, these links are circumstantial and in the majority of individuals developing MDS no obvious connection with environmental hazards can be found. MDS sometimes runs in families, suggesting a genetic link with the disease, but apart from an association with a rare congenital form of anemia (Fanconi aplastic anemia), no definite MDS provoking gene has been found. Myelodysplastic syndromes affect males slightly more often than females. The disorder occurs in any age group, but is far more common in older adults, occurring most often in individuals over 60 years of age. According to one estimate, 22 to 45 per 100,000 people over the age of 70 years have MDS. Approximately 20,000 new patients are diagnosed each year in the United States. The number of new cases diagnosed each year is increasing, possibly due to better recognition of the disorder combined with an increasing proportion of elderly adults in the general population. Determining the exact frequency of MDS in the general population is difficult because of lack of reporting of patients with mild cytopenias A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests including complete blood counts, examination of the blood smear (often more than one is needed), and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. A complete blood count measures the number of red and white blood cells and platelets in the body. The blood smear and the small sample of bone marrow removed via a needle (the aspirate) is examined under a microscope for the characteristic features of MDS. Chromosome analysis is helpful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.\n', 'Congenital lactic acidosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of congenital lactic acidosis is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 250-300 live births per 1,000 per year in the United States. However, it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of congenital lactic acidosis in the general population. A diagnosis of congenital lactic acidosis is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests can reveal certain findings associated with congenital lactic acidosis such as elevated levels of lactate. An enzyme deficiency may be diagnosed by tests conducted in white blood cells or in skin or muscle cells obtained by biopsy.\n', 'Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a rare congenital heart disorder involving irregularities in the electrical system of the heart. In individuals with WPW syndrome, an abnormal alternate electrical pathway (accessory pathway), exists between the atrium and the ventricle, resulting in abnormal heartbeat rhythms (arrhythmias) and faster than normal heartbeats (tachycardia). WPW syndrome is often present at birth (congenital), but may not be detected until adolescence or later. Peak incidence has been reported in individuals between 30 and 40 years old in otherwise healthy adults. Some reports suggest that WPW syndrome occurs in males more often than females. The disorder’s estimated prevalence is .1-3.1 per 1,000 people in the United States.\n', 'Hepatorenal syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of hepatorenal syndrome is unknown. It is estimated to occur in approximately 8-10 percent of individuals with the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and cirrhosis. Although it is most common in individuals with advanced cirrhosis and ascites, hepatorenal syndrome has also occurs in individuals with other forms of liver disease including fulminant hepatic failure.\n', '"Dentin dysplasia type I is an inherited disorder characterized by atypical development of the ""dentin"" of a person\'s teeth. Dentin makes up most of the tooth and is the bone-like material under the enamel. It serves to contain the pulp of the tooth. The pulp is a soft tissue that is well supplied with blood vessels and nerves. This disorder is also known as radicular dentin dysplasia because the underdeveloped, abnormal pulp tissue is predominately in the roots of the teeth. The teeth lack pulp chambers or have half-moon shaped pulp chambers in short or abnormally shaped roots. The condition may affect juvenile as well as adult teeth and, since the roots are abnormally short, usually leads to the premature loss of teeth.  The color of the teeth is usually normal. Dentin dysplasia type I appears to affect about 1 in 100,000 persons.  Males and females are apparently equally at risk. Diagnosis is usually based on x-rays taken when some abnormality is suspected."\n', 'Paget’s disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that almost exclusively affects women. However, there have been rare cases in which the disorder has occurred in men. Paget’s disease of the breast most commonly affects middle-aged individuals, primarily occurring between 50 to 60 years of age, although it has been reported in individuals in their 20s. It is thought to represent less than 5 percent of all breast cancer clinical presentations. The exact prevalence and incidence of Paget’s disease of the breast in the general population is unknown.\n', 'Cutis laxa is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder has been reported in approximately 400 families worldwide. Cutis laxa is estimated to affect 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. However, because cases may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed determining the true frequency of cutis laxa in the general population is difficult. Cutis laxa affects individuals of all races and every ethnic group. A diagnosis of cutis laxa is based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Surgical removal and microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin can reveal characteristic changes in elastic fibers. Distinguishing between the specific genetic forms of cutis laxa can be difficult. Molecular genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis of an inherited form cutis laxa and establish the specific, underlying subtype in some cases. Molecular genetic testing can detect mutations in specific genes known to cause cutis laxa, but is available only as a diagnostic service at specialized laboratories.\n', 'Psittacosis is an uncommon infectious disease that is most often transmitted to humans through exposure to infected birds, especially parrots, cockatiels, parakeets and similar pet birds. Psittacosis can affect the lungs and may cause inflammatory illness of the lungs (pneumonia). Additional common symptoms include fever, muscle pain (myalgia), headaches, and a dry cough. The diagnosis of psittacosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests such as specialized blood tests that reveal characteristic antibodies, produced by the body in response to psittacosis infection. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the body to fight off foreign material such as bacteria.\n', 'The diagnosis of Behçet’s syndrome is made based on the clinical judgment of a physician. Criteria have been accepted, based upon the identification of recurrent oral ulcerations (aphthous stomatitis) that occur along with at least two of the following: eye lesions, skin lesions, recurrent genital ulcerations, and a positive pathergy test. (During a pathergy test, a physician pricks an individual with a sterile needle. A positive outcome occurs if a reddish spot (nodule or pustule) forms 48 hours after the prick.) However, these criteria have been formed so that patients might be included in clinical studies (“classification criteria”) and are not really “diagnostic” criteria.\n', 'Tenosynovial giant cell tumors mainly affect individuals between 25-40 years of age, with a median age of diagnosis of 30. However, these tumors can affect the elderly and younger children as well. There is a slight female preponderance in some studies. The incidence is estimated to be 1.8 people per 1 million people in the general population based on a study conducted in the United States in 1980.\n', 'Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a rare disease that is present at birth (congenital) and affects the liver. CHF rarely occurs as an isolated problem, and is usually associated with ciliopathies that affect the kidneys, called hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (FCD). These include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), nephronophthisis (NPHP) chronic tubulointerstitial disease, and others. Typical liver abnormalities include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), increased pressure in the venous system that carries blood from different organs to the liver (portal hypertension), and fiber-like connective tissue that spreads over and through the liver (hepatic fibrosis). Gastrointestinal (stomach and intestine) bleeding, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and hypersplenism (decreased platelet and other blood counts due to enlarged spleen) may be early signs of this condition. The frequency of CHF is not known. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1/10,000 -20,000 based on the prevalence of ciliopathies that are associated with CHF. CHF is diagnosed by ultrasound exam and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and kidneys, and rarely, by liver biopsy. CHF and Caroli’s syndrome are often associated with cystic disease of the kidneys. Family history, physical exam, and various tests including kidney ultrasound exam, kidney function tests, X-rays, eye exam, brain MRI, and molecular genetic testing can help to determine the underlying FCD syndrome.\n', 'Status epilepticus (SE) is considered a neurological emergency. Left untreated (or undertreated), prolonged seizures can cause permanent neurological injury or death. Rapid treatment must be initiated. If initial agents fail, it may be necessary to induce an iatrogenic coma. In any case, the person in status epilepticus must be closely watched, and often requires continuous EEG in order to confirm that the seizures have stopped not only clinically but electrically as well. It is estimated that 150,000 people develop epilepsy each year in the United States. Per the MMWR report from the CDC, the overall prevalence for Epilepsy is 4.6/1000 in the general population while it is 4.1/1000 for population less than 15 years in age. The incidence of Epilepsy is more predominant in the extremes of age i.e. more frequent among children and older adults. Approximately 15 percent of people who have epilepsy have Status Epilepticus. Combined together approximately two to three million Americans have epilepsy but the majority of affected individuals are seizure free due to effective medications.\n', 'Ferroportin disease affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of ferroportin disease is unknown. Researchers believe that the disorder occurs more frequently than has been reported in the medical literature. Ferroportin affects individuals of all races and ethnicities. Some researchers believe that ferroportin disease is the most common form of hereditary iron overload after classic (type 1) hemochromatosis.\n', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a chronic infectious tropical disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The initial infection usually occurs in the lungs, but may also spread to the skin, mucous membranes, and other parts of the body. Specialized cells that line the walls of blood and lymphatic vessels and dispose of cellular waste (reticuloendothelial system) may also be affected by paracoccidioidomycosis. If the patient does not receive treatment, life-threatening complications can occur. Most cases of this disease occur in South and Central America.\n', 'Psoriatic, Arthritis is a rheumatoid-like arthritic condition characterized by pain and swelling (inflammation) of the joints (arthritis) that occurs in association with gray discoloration or scaly plaques of the skin (psoriasis). Abnormalities of the nails may also be present. In many cases, skin symptoms precede the development of arthritis by several years. The exact cause of the psoriatic arthritis is unknown. Depending upon the medical literature, of the many Americans who have psoriasis, anywhere from five to 40 percent develop psoriatic arthritis. It is more common in women and usually first appears between the ages of 20 and 50 years, but onset can occur at any age.\n', 'Partial androgen sensitivity syndrome is very rare in the general population. 1 in 99,000 male infants are born with one of the several androgen sensitivity syndrome types, including PAIS. PAIS only affects males, but females can be carriers for this genetic condition.\n', 'Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by massive overgrowth of mucous cells (foveola) in the mucous membrane lining the stomach, resulting in large gastric folds. The most common symptom associated with Menetrier disease is pain in the upper middle region of the stomach (epigastric pain). The cause of Menetrier disease is unknown. Menetrier disease affects males slightly more often than females. It most often affects adults in their 50s or older. However, a childhood form of the disorder exists. Because of the confusion in the literature regarding the term Menetrier disease, it is difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Menetrier disease may be suspected in individuals with large gastric folds. Large gastric folds may be diagnosed by a radiologic study after the patient drinks a barium solution or by an endoscopic exam, a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and used to examine the interior of the stomach and, if necessary, to obtain tissue samples for microscopic study (biopsy). Histopathologic study of affected stomach tissue obtained by biopsy can support a diagnosis of Menetrier disease. Histopathology is the study of microscopic anatomical changes in diseased tissue.\n', '"Leri Pleonosteosis is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by unusual, flattened facial features, abnormalities of the hands and feet, skeletal malformations, short stature, and/or limitation of joint movements. Characteristic abnormalities of the hands and feet may include unusually broad and/or short thumbs and great toes (brachydactyly) that may be bent outward from the body (valgus position); as a result, the hands may have a ""spade-shaped"" appearance. Skeletal malformations may include knees that are bent backward (genu recurvitum) and abnormal enlargement of the cartilaginous structures that surround the upper portion of the spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae). In addition, affected individuals may develop thickened tissue on the palms (palmar) and forearms. Symptoms may vary from case to case. Leri pleonosteosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Leri pleonosteosis is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Approximately 20 cases have been reported worldwide, with most of these outside of North America. The symptoms and physical characteristics associated with Leri pleonosteosis usually become apparent during infancy or early childhood. The diagnosis of Leri pleonosteosis may be established by a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, detailed patient history, and/or specialized tests including advanced imaging techniques (e.g., various x-ray methods). For example, enlargement of the cartilage that surrounds the upper spinal cord (posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae), is an important characteristic of this disorder and is potentially detectable by x-ray studies."\n', 'The prevalence (the number of people with a disorder in a given population at a given time) is unknown. Researchers estimate that .1-.3% of people in the general population of the United States have the disorder. SMA syndrome occurs with greater frequency among teenagers and young adults, but can occur in individuals of any age. The disorder tends to affect women more often than men by a ratio of 3:2. SMA syndrome can affect individuals of any racial or ethic heritage.\n', 'Caudal regression syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder has been estimated to be 1 in 5 per 100,000 live births. The disorder occurs with greater frequency among women with diabetes.\n', 'Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia is a rare bone marrow disorder characterized by an isolated decline of red blood cells (erythrocytes) produced by the bone marrow. Affected individuals may experience fatigue, lethargy, and/or abnormal paleness of the skin (pallor). Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia may occur for unknown reasons (idiopathic) or as a primary autoimmune disorder. It is also believed that Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia may occur secondary to a tumor of the thymus gland (thyoma), viral infections, or certain drugs. Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia is thought to be an autoimmune disorder possibly caused either by a tumor of the thymus gland, certain drugs or a viral infection. It is one of a group of bone marrow failure syndromes. Acquired Pure Red Cell Aplasia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'Fewer than 1 in 100,000 people are diagnosed with ET in any year (the most recent estimates range from 0.38 to 1.7 per 100,000). Women are more likely to be diagnosed with ET than men, although the reason for this is unknown. The average age of onset is mid-fifties, but the range is wide, and includes women in their childbearing years, which makes up an important subset of ET patients with special therapeutic considerations (discussed below). In children ET is exceedingly rare and typically is an inherited genetic disorder. In adults, the genetic mutations typically identified in ET (described below) are not inherited, and instead are acquired genetic accidents (known as an acquired mutation) that happen during an individual’s lifetime. Genetic accidents happen to all of us as we age, although they do not always result in a disease.\n', 'Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q is a rare chromosomal disorder in which there is deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the 4th chromosome. Associated symptoms and findings may be variable, depending upon the specific length and location of the deleted portion of chromosome 4. However, characteristic features include growth deficiency after birth (postnatal growth retardation), varying degrees of mental retardation, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, structural heart defects, abnormalities of the hands and feet, and/or other physical findings. Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q usually appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early during embryonic development that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Partial deletion of chromosome 4q was originally reported in a child in 1967.  Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q was proposed as a distinct chromosomal syndrome with characteristic symptoms and findings in 1979.  More than 30 patients with the syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those associated with Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'There are 23 pairs of human chromosomes, or a total of 46 chromosomes. Mosaic trisomy 22 is characterized by an extra copy of the chromosome 22 (trisomy) in some of the body cell populations. This could be due to an error during the division of reproductive cells in one of the parents (mitotic nondisjunction) or during cellular division after fertilization (fetal mitosis). The disorder can also occur in association with uniparental disomy, an abnormality in which affected individuals have inherited both copies of a chromosomal pair from one parent, rather than one copy from each parent. The presence of the additional chromosome 22 in some groups of cells is responsible for the symptoms and physical findings of the disorder.\n', 'Diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Most cases have been reported infants and children, but the disorder has occurred in adults as well. The disorder has been reported in individuals of every race and ethnicity. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. The disorder often goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine true frequency of diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis in the general population.\n', 'Susac syndrome is an autoimmune endotheliopathy, a disorder in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the inside lining (endothelium) of the walls of the very tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the brain, retina, and inner ear. The exact, underlying reason why this occurs is unknown. Why the microvasculature in the brain, retina, and inner ear are primarily affected is also unclear. The skin may also be involved.\n', "Galactosemia is a rare, hereditary disorder of carbohydrate metabolism that affects the body's ability to convert galactose (a sugar contained in milk, including human mother's milk) to glucose (a different type of sugar). The disorder is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase (GALT) which is vital to this process. Early diagnosis and treatment with a lactose-restricted (dairy-free) diet is absolutely essential to avoid profound intellectual disability, liver failure and death in the newborn period. Galactosemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic condition. Classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia can both result in life-threatening health problems unless treatment is started shortly after birth. A biochemical variant form of galactosemia termed Duarte is not thought to cause clinical disease due to lactose consumption.\n", 'Dentinogenesis imperfecta type III (DGI-III) is one of five distinct, hereditary disorders of dentin development affecting the teeth. Dentin is the hard, bone-like material that makes up most of a tooth and lies under the enamel serving to protect the soft, pulp tissue. These heritable dentin disorders may affect only the teeth or may be associated with the condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta. Whether this association is present is a major criterion in the classification of dentinogenesis imperfecta into three types. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type III is characterized by rapid erosion of the crowns in baby and permanent teeth.  Dental pulp inside several teeth may be exposed.  This pulp may be opalescent, smooth, and amber colored.  Pulp chambers and root canals may appear very large on X-ray photos of baby teeth. Permanent teeth may have a reduction or even complete loss of the pulp chambers and root canals.  Carriers of the gene for this disorder may have teeth that appear normal.  However, upon examination their teeth have only an extremely thin ivory layer and an enlarged pulp chamber (shell teeth).  Pitting of the tooth enamel may occur in the permanent teeth of patients. X-rays of the teeth are key to the diagnosis after a thorough family history and clinical examination.\n', '"Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the filtering structures (glomeruli) of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and excessive bleeding into the lungs (pulmonary hemorrhaging). Autoimmune syndromes occur when the body\'s natural defenses (antibodies) against invading or ""foreign"" organisms begin to attack the body\'s own tissue, often for unknown reasons. Symptoms of Goodpasture syndrome include recurrent episodes of coughing up of blood (hemoptysis), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), fatigue, chest pain, and/or abnormally low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia). In many cases, Goodpasture syndrome may result in an inability of the kidneys to process waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine (acute renal failure). In some cases of Goodpasture syndrome, affected individuals have had an upper respiratory tract infection before the development of the disorder. The exact cause of Goodpasture syndrome is not known. A diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome may be suspected based upon the identification of characteristic physical findings (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhaging and glomerulonephritis). The diagnosis may be confirmed by the identification of the presence of anti-glomerular basement membranes antibodies in the body. In some cases, affected individuals may exhibit blood (hematuria) and/or protein (proteinuria) in the urine."\n', 'Kawasaki disease is an acute multisystem inflammatory disease of blood vessels (vasculitis) that most commonly affects infants and young children. The disease may be characterized by a high fever, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat, a reddish skin rash, and swelling of lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). In addition, individuals with Kawasaki disease may develop inflammation of arteries that transport blood to heart muscle (coronary arteritis), associated widening or bulging (aneurysms) of the walls of affected coronary arteries, inflammation of heart muscle (myocarditis), and/or other symptoms and findings. Kawasaki disease is the primary cause of acquired heart disease in children in the United States. Although the cause of the disease is unknown, it is widely thought to be due to infection or an abnormal immune response to infection. Kawasaki disease most frequently affects children five years of age or younger. In extremely rare cases, Kawasaki disease may occur during adolescence or adulthood. First reported in Japanese children in the 1960s, the disease is now recognized worldwide and occurs in individuals in all racial and ethnic groups. However, Kawasaki disease appears to affect Asian children most frequently. Estimates indicate that at least 3,000 cases of Kawasaki disease are diagnosed each year in the United States.  Males appear to be affected more frequently than females by a ratio of approximately 1.5 to 1.\n', "Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (sutures) between certain bones in the skull (craniosynostosis), unusually small eyes (microphthalmia), absence of some teeth (hypodontia), and/or excessive amounts of hair (hypertrichosis) on most areas of the body. Affected individuals may also exhibit a mild delay in physical development (growth retardation); short fingers and/or toes; and/or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the two long folds of skin on either side of the vaginal opening (labia majora) in females. In addition, there may be an abnormal opening between the two large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart (pulmonary artery and aorta), causing inappropriate recirculation of some blood through the lungs, rather than throughout the rest of the body (patent ductus arteriosus). In some cases, mild mental retardation may also be present. It is believed that Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Approximately four cases have been reported in the medical literature. Although all reported cases have involved females, the true ratio of affected females to males is not known. The first case of Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome was reported in the medical literature in 1960. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be diagnosed at birth, based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. The presence of patent ductus arteriosus occurring in association with Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be determined by a variety of tests. When an abnormal heart murmur is detected, chest X-rays may be ordered along with an electrocardiogram (ECG), a test that measures the heart muscle's electrical activity. Structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and its blood vessels can be analyzed through the reflection of sound waves (echocardiogram). Conductive hearing loss occurring in association with Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome can be diagnosed by a battery of tests that measures the functioning of the middle ear (conductive loss battery).\n", 'Fraser syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by partial webbing of the fingers and/or toes (partial syndactyly), kidney (renal) abnormalities, genital malformations, and/or, in some cases, complete fusion of the eyelids (cryptophthalmos) that may be associated with malformation of the eyes, causing blindness. In infants with Fraser syndrome, renal malformations may include improper development (dysplasia), underdevelopment (hypoplasia), or absence of one or both kidneys (unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis). In affected males, one or both testes may fail to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism), the urinary opening (meatus) may be abnormally placed on the underside of the penis (hypospadias), and/or the penis may be abnormally small (micropenis). Affected females may have malformed fallopian tubes, an abnormally enlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly), and/or an abnormally shaped uterus (bicornate uterus). In addition, the folds of skin on either side of the vaginal opening (labia) may be abnormally fused. Infants and children with Fraser syndrome may also have additional abnormalities including malformations of the middle and outer ear that may result in hearing impairment. Fraser syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Fraser syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Diagnosis depends on a good family history and physical examination. Confirmation is generall. easy and is performed by means of imaging devices.\n', 'Simian B Virus Infection is caused by a type of herpesvirus. It is an infectious disorder contracted chiefly by laboratory workers exposed to infected monkeys and/or simian tissue cultures. It is characterized by a viral invasion of the brain (Encephalitis) and the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain. Occasionally, the infection affects the spinal cord structures as well (Encephalomyelitis). Neurological damage may result from this infection. Without treatment, some cases of Simian B Virus may be life- threatening. Simian B Virus Infection is characterized by fever, headache, vomiting, discomfort (malaise), and a stiff neck and back.  These symptoms may be associated with neuromuscular dysfunction, respiratory difficulties, vision problems, cranial nerve abnormalities, alteration of consciousness, personality changes, seizures and/or partial paralysis (paresis).  Some patients may go into a coma.\n', 'The methylmalonic acidemias are organic acidemias caused by an enzymatic defect in the metabolism of four amino acids (methionine, threonine, isoleucine and valine). This results in an abnormally high level of acid in the blood (academia) and body tissues. In the acute form, drowsiness, coma, and seizures may occur. Mental retardation is a long-term consequence. The disorder may be caused by a deficiency of one or more of the enzymes methylmalonyl CoA mutase, methylmalonyl racemase, or adenosylcobalamin synthetic enzymes. Excretion of methylmalonate, a product of amino acid metabolism, in the urine is abnormally high and therefore is a marker of the disorder. All known organic acidemias are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The Methylmalonic Acidemias occur at a rate of 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births.\n', 'Initial reports have shown more females being affected than males. Larger groups of patients will need to be identified to confirm whether women are affected more often than men. Less than 100 families have been identified with this disorder in the medical literature, but the exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. The low number of people identified with this disorder is because COPA syndrome was only first defined as a disorder in 2015, and genetic testing has only recently become available. In general, rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. COPA syndrome is likely underrecognized and underdiagnosed.\n', "Depersonalization disorder is a psychiatric disorder affecting emotions and behavior. It is characterized by an alteration in how an affected individual perceives or experiences his or her unique sense of self. The usual sense of one's own reality is temporarily lost or changed. A feeling of detachment from, or being an outside observer of, one's mental processes or body occurs such as the sensation of being in a dream. The exact cause of depersonalization disorder is not known.  A traumatic event such as military combat, a car accident, or being a victim of a violent crime may trigger an episode of depersonalization disorder.  Substance use may cause depersonalization episodes, but not the disorder. Depersonalization disorder is believed to affect women twice as much as men.  The disorder most commonly affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 30.  It is rarely seen in those over the age of 40. The diagnosis of depersonalization disorder can be suspected after a complete physical examination and laboratory tests have ruled out any substance or geneal medical condition. A complete psychiatric evaluation should also be conducted.\n", "Dracunculosis is an infection caused by a parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, the guinea worm. Infected water fleas release the larvae of the worm into drinking water. Ingestion of contaminated water causes the larvae to migrate from the intestines via the abdominal cavity to the tissue under the skin. The larvae mature and release a toxic substance that makes the overlying skin ulcerate. After treatment, symptoms disappear and the worms can be safely removed from the skin. Dracunculosis is characterized by chronic skin ulcers.  Tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae of the parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, or Guinea worm.  A female worm ready to release larvae produces stinging elevated spots (papules), causing redness and itching of the skin.  These symptoms may be an allergic reaction to the parasite.  The spots form blisters and later rupture, developing into painful ulcers.  Multiple ulcers (usually on the legs) are common.  Without treatment, the worms are absorbed or protrude from the skin over a period of several weeks. The cause of dracunculosis is the consumption of water contaminated by the larvae of the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis, which live in an intermediate host in the water.  The larvae are released from the intermediate host while in the stomach, where they mate and grow.  This stage lasts for as long as a year.  The female apparently survives this process and may grow to three feet in length.  The symptoms and characteristic ulcers and infections occur when the female moves from the stomach or intestine to tissues under the skin. In 1986, there were approximately 3.2 million cases of dracunculosis worldwide.  However, due to the efforts of several national and international organizations in cooperation with local governments, the incidence of the disease has significantly decreased.  According to current estimates, there are now fewer than 100,000 cases of dracunculosis worldwide, with the remaining cases primarily occurring in Sudan and certain countries in West Africa, such as Nigeria and Niger. In individuals with dracunculosis, the condition is diagnosed based upon characteristic symptoms (e.g., fever, pain, and blistering and ulceration of the affected area) in association with the emergence of the adult worm through the individual's skin.\n", 'Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is a rare disorder that can strike persons whose immune system is deficient or suppressed and who have received a bone marrow transplant or a nonirradiated blood transfusion. Symptoms may include skin rash, intestinal problems and liver dysfunction. GVHD is caused by donor T cells recognizing foreign antigens (histocompatibility or human leucocyte antigens) on the recipient’s cells and reacting to them. Prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplants recipients usually undergo myeloablative treatment with radiation or chemotherapy to destroy their own diseased bone marrow and weaken their immune system. When receiving the bone marrow or stem cell transplant, immunocompetent donor lymphocytes recognize foreign minor locus histocompatibility antigens on the recipient’s cells resulting in GVHD. GVHD affects males and females of all ages who have been immunosuppressed before being given a bone marrow transplant or a nonirradiated blood transfusion containing allogeneic lymphocytes. The risk of GVHD usually increases with the recipient’s age and with the degree of HLA differences between donor and recipient unless fully T-cell depleted.\n', 'Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is a genetic degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord that begins before birth. The disorder is characterized by growth failure at birth and little or no neurological development, structural abnormalities of the eye and fixed bending of the spine and joints.  Abnormalities of the skull, face, limbs and other parts of the body may also occur. COFS syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. COFS is now considered to be part of the spectrum of disorders within Cockayne syndrome. Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome is a very rare disorder present at birth.  It affects males and females and occurs in many ethnic groups. The diagnosis of COFS syndrome is often made based on physical features seen at birth. X-ra. studies may reveal displacement of the small foot bones between the ankle and toes (second metatarsals) and neuroimaging studies may show reduced white matter with gray matter mottling. DNA repair studies on skin fibroblast cells may help to confirm a diagnosis of COFS syndrome. Molecular genetic testing to identify mutations in the excision repair genes is available on a research basis only.\n', 'Nelson syndrome is a disorder characterized by abnormal hormone secretion, enlargement of the pituitary gland (hypophysis), and the development of large and invasive growths known as adenomas. It occurs in an estimated 15 to 25 percent of people who undergo surgical removal of the adrenal glands for Cushing disease. Symptoms associated with Nelson syndrome include intense skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation), headaches, vision impairment, and the cessation of menstrual periods in women. Symptoms of Nelson syndrome include intense skin pigmentation, headaches, visual field disturbances and the cessation of menstrual periods in females. Blood levels of the pituitary hormones adrenocorticotrope hormone (ACTH) and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) are abnormally high.  The pituitary gland gets abnormally large in Nelson syndrome, causing headaches and visceral symptoms. Nelson syndrome can be caused by surgical removal of the adrenal glands on both sides of the body (bilateral adrenalectomy).  Removal of the adrenal glands is a treatment for Cushing disease.  Cushing disease is the name given to a condition in which Cushing syndrome, an endocrine disorder, occurs because of the presence of benign (non-cancerous) tumors on the pituitary gland.  Following removal of these adrenal glands, some people will develop Nelson syndrome.  Growth of a pre-existing or a concealed (occult) tumor of the pituitary gland may also cause this disorder. Nelson syndrome affects approximately 15 to 25% of people who have undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.  It affects males and females in equal numbers.  Cases caused by tumors are very rare. When Nelson syndrome is suspected, blood samples are analyzed for the presence or absence of cortisol and/or aldosterone. Imaging studies such as CAT scans or magnetic resonance imaging may also be used.\n', "Bell's palsy is a non-progressive neurological disorder of one of the facial nerves (7th cranial nerve). This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that may be preceded by a slight fever, pain behind the ear on the affected side, a stiff neck, and weakness and/or stiffness on one side of the face. Paralysis results from decreased blood supply (ischemia) and/or compression of the 7th cranial nerve. The exact cause of Bell's palsy is not known. Viral (e.g., herpes zoster virus) and immune disorders are frequently implicated as a cause for this disorder. There may also be an inherited tendency toward developing Bell's palsy. The exact cause of Bell’s palsy is not known. Viral and immune disorders are often implicated as a cause for this disorder. There may also be an inherited tendency toward developing Bell’s palsy. Symptoms develop due to deficiency of blood supply and pressure on the 7th cranial nerve as a result of nerve swelling. A preliminary diagnosis may be made by the physician upon looking at the patient's face and noticing the difficulty the patient has in moving the facial muscles. Electromyography, a test that measure the electrical conductivity of the nerve, may be administered to confirm the diagnosis and to measure the extent of the nerve damage.\n", 'Sacrococcygeal teratomas occur in females more often than males by a 4:1 ratio. Malignancy is more common in males. The prevalence of these tumors is estimated to be between 1 in 30,000-70,000 live births. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common solid tumor found in newborn babies (neonates). The sacrococcygeal region is the most common site for a teratoma in infants. Sacrococcygeal teratomas affecting adults is extremely rare. Adults cases often represent tumors that were present at birth (congenital), but not detected until adulthood.\n', 'Choroideremia affects primarily males. Female carriers generally have few or no symptoms. However, a small number of females develop the disorder as a result of a genetic process that inactivates the normal gene and leaves only the dysfunctional gene active. In the Salla area of northern Finland, an unusually high number of people have been diagnosed with choroideremia; approximately one in forty persons. A doctor will perform tests that examine the patient’s visual field suspected of having choroideremia and will look inside the eye for degeneration of the retina. Genetic testing is available for some genetic variants that cause choroideremia. The symptoms of choroideremia can be treated but the disease itself cannot yet be cured. Organizations providing services to sight impaired people help patients and their families. Genetic counseling is recommended for families affected by this disorder.\n', 'Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a complex genetic neurodegenerative disorder that may become apparent during infancy or early childhood. The disorder is characterized by progressively impaired coordination of voluntary movements (ataxia), the development of reddish lesions of the skin and mucous membranes due to permanent widening of groups of blood vessels (telangiectasia), and impaired functioning of the immune system (i.e., cellular and humoral immunodeficiency), resulting in increased susceptibility to upper and lower respiratory infections (sinopulmonary infections). Individuals with AT also have an increased risk of developing certain malignancies, particularly of the lymphatic system (lymphomas), the blood-forming organs (e.g., leukemia), and the brain. Ataxia telangiectasia usually begins during infancy (between one and three years of age) and often affects more than one child in a family. Males and females may be affected in equal numbers. In the United States, the prevalence is approximately one in 40,000-100,000 live births.\n', 'Neonatal herpes is a rare disorder affecting newborn infants infected with the herpes simplex virus (HSV), also called herpesvirus hominis. In most instances, a parent with oral or genital herpes transfers the disorder to an offspring before, during, or shortly after birth. Symptoms vary from mild to severe depending on which of two types of herpes simplex virus is involved. Type 1 HSV is responsible for the more severe cases of the disorder while patients with Type 2 HSV usually present with milder symptoms. The diagnosis of neonatal herpes is difficult and requires the physician to maintain a high level of skepticism and wariness. Frequently, neither parent is aware that he or she is carrying the virus. HSV infection must be considered for any neonate presenting with non-specific symptoms such as fever, poor feeding, lethargy and/or seizure. Any rash accompanyied by fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) should be cultured for HSV, and because such tests take days before the results are known, anti-viral treatment should be started.\n', 'Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II (TRPS2), also known as Langer-Giedion syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS2 is characterized by fine, thin hair; unusual facial features; progressive growth retardation resulting in short stature (dwarfism); abnormally short fingers and toes (brachydactyly); "cone-shaped" formation of the "growing ends" of certain bones (epiphyseal coning); and/or development of multiple bony growths (exostoses) projecting outward from the surfaces of various bones of the body. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit unusually flexible (hyperextensible) joints, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), excess folds of skin (redundant skin), and/or discolored elevated spots on the skin (maculopapular nevi). Affected individuals may also exhibit mild to severe mental retardation, hearing loss (sensorineural deafness), and/or delayed speech development. The range and severity of symptoms varies greatly from case to case. TRPS2 is due to the absence of genetic material (chromosomal deletions) on chromosome 8. The size of the deletion varies from case to case.', 'Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare malignant brain tumor. Astrocytomas are tumors that develop from certain star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes and similar cells form tissue that surrounds and protects other nerve cells found within the brain and spinal cord. Collectively, these cells are known as glial cells and the tissue they form is known as glial tissue. Tumors that arise from glial tissue, including astrocytomas, are collectively referred to as gliomas. The symptoms of anaplastic astrocytomas vary depending upon the specific location and size of the tumor. The specific cause of this tumor is unknown.\n', 'In ichthyosis vulgaris, the skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not shed normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) and are not shed as quickly as they should be. The result is a build-up of scale. Fine scales usually develop on the back and over muscles near the joints, such as an elbow or knee (extensor muscles). Ichthyosis is usually most common and severe over the lower legs. Ichthyosis vulgaris is an inherited disorder transmitted through an autosomal dominant inheritance.  The specific genetic defect that causes ichthyosis vulgaris is not yet identified.  Human traits, including classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or the father) will be expressed, dominating the other normal gene and resulting in the appearance of the disease.  In the case of ichthyosis vulgaris, the gene for the disease overrides the gene for normal skin and the individual shows the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from an affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy, regardless of the sex of the child. Ichthyosis vulgaris is a fairly common disorder that affects approximately one in 250 persons in the United States.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Ichthyosis vulgaris is treated topically with moisturizers containing urea or glycerol. Lotions containing alpha-hydroxy acids may help. However, some individuals with ichthyosis vulgaris also may experience atopic dermatitis (red, itchy patches of skin) and the alpha-hydroxy acids may irritate their skin.\n', 'Sporadic porencephaly is a rare disorder affecting the central nervous system. In porencephaly, cysts or cavities form on the surface of the brain. These cysts or cavities may become filled with cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid that normally surrounds the brain and spinal cord to provide protection and nourishment. The severity and associated symptoms of porencephaly vary dramatically from one person to another based upon the size and exact locations of the fluid-filled cavities or cysts. Some infants develop serious complications shortly after birth; others individuals may have mild symptoms that may go undetected. The exact incidence of sporadic porencephaly in the general population is unknown. Some researchers believe that some patients may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. Sporadic porencephaly affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of sporadic porencephaly can be made before or after birth through a variety of specialized imaging tests such as an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During an ultrasound, reflected sound waves are used to make an image of the developing fetus. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues.\n', 'The underlying cause of carcinoid tumors remains unclear. Some studies have suggested risk factors such as smoking and dietary intake, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. In the majority of cases tumors are slow-growing and can produce hormonal chemical substances such as serotonin, bradykinins, tachykinins and prostaglandins. If the original carcinoid cells spread (metastasize) to the liver, these substances are no longer broken down to their inactive form and are released into the systemic (main) circulation, causing the signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. When tumors affect organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the ovaries, carcinoid syndrome can occur in the absence of liver metastases. Carcinoid tumors are rare, with only 27 new cases per million diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Of these, only about 10% will develop carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. All races can be affected though there is a slightly increased prevalence in black African males. All ages can be affected but most gastrointestinal cases occur in middle-age. Bronchial (airway) tumors are most often seen in the fifth decade but can affect people at any age. Carcinoid syndrome may be more prevalent than suspected because diagnosis is difficult and sometimes overlooked; some patients may not exhibit all three of the hallmark symptoms of flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is best achieved with a multimodality approach including biochemical investigation, radiological and nuclear imaging, and finally histological (tissue biopsy) confirmation where possible. The occurrence of episodic facial flushing and/or chronic diarrhea not diagnosed by standard tests as being a result of more common causes should lead to suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. In the past, measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyendolacetic acid (5-HIAA), a product of the breakdown (metabolism) of serotonin, in a patient on a low serotonin diet was the main lab test used. It is still useful and the level of 5-HIAA will be clearly elevated in 50% of the cases. However, there are also blood tests available, the most useful being chromogranin-A, often in combination with an imaging technique known as octreoscan, that may confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome even when urinary 5-HIAA is normal. This technique may also be helpful in indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors when the full spectrum of symptoms is not apparent. Other investigations that may be helpful, depending on the location of the primary tumor, include CT scan, ultrasound, MRI and endoscopy. Sometimes the diagnosis is established incidentally at the time of surgery for another suspected condition such as intestinal obstruction or appendicitis.\n', 'Adult polyglucosan body disease is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal proportions. Familial clustering is observed in about 30% of cases especially among Ashkenazi Jewish populations. More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A wide variety of disorders can be mistaken for APBD. Such disorders include multiple sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, adrenomyeloneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Men with primarily urinary symptoms may be mistaken for having an enlarged prostate (prostate hypertrophy).\n', 'Cyclic neutropenia is a rare blood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of abnormally low levels of certain white blood cells (neutrophils) in the body. Neutrophils are instrumental in fighting off infection by surrounding and destroying bacteria that enter the body. Symptoms associated with cyclic neutropenia may include fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), and/or sores (ulcers) of the mucous membranes of the mouth. In most cases, individuals with low levels of neutrophils (neutropenia) are abnormally susceptible to recurrent infections.\n', 'Common symptoms of MWS include recurrent rashes beginning in infancy or early childhood, intermittent fevers, joint pain (usually with no apparent changes in tissue and cartilage), recurrent conjunctivitis (the inflammation of the outer most layer of the eye causing redness, discomfort and discharge from the eye), progressive hearing loss and amyloidosis. Symptoms can be unprecipitated, but can also be triggered by cold exposure as well as stress or exercise. Episodes generally last between 24 to 48 hours. Since MWS is a newly discovered condition, the actual incidence and prevalence of the disease are difficult to determine. Diagnosis of MWS is determined through an evaluation of a patient’s symptoms. Confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through genetic testing and the identification of a CIAS1/NLRP3 mutation, although not all MWS patients possess a mutation in this gene.\n', 'May-Hegglin Anomaly is a rare, inherited, blood platelet disorder characterized by abnormally large and misshapen platelets (giant platelets) and defects of the white blood cells known as leukocytes. The defect of the white blood cells consists of the presence of very small (2-5 micrometers) rods, known as Dohle bodies, in the fluid portion of the cell (cytoplasm). Some people with this disorder may have no symptoms while others may have various bleeding abnormalities. In mild cases, treatment for May-Hegglin Anomaly is not usually necessary. In more severe cases, transfusions of blood platelets may be necessary. May-Hegglin Anomaly is a rare blood platelet disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It occurs more often in people of Greek or Italian descent than among others.  As of about 10 years ago, only about 170 cases were reported in the literature.\n', 'Type I glycogen storage disease occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 births. The prevalence of GSDI in Ashkenazi Jews is approximately 1 in 20,000. This condition affects males and females in equal numbers in any given population group.\n', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of leukemia found in multiple family members. It is twice as common in males as in females and the average age of onset in patients is 72. It is also more common in people that are white, or of Russian and Eastern European Jewish heritage. The rate of incidence of the disorder increases with age. CLL almost never affects children and is rare under the age of thirty. In the United States, it is thought that three out of every 100,000 people will develop CLL, but this may be an underestimate.\n', 'RYR-1-related diseases are classified as an orphan disease. The prevalence is approximately 1/90,000 in the United States. The disorder most likely goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. There are also reports of slightly increased prevalence in certain ethnic and geographic populations. The most definitive diagnostic test for RYR-1-related diseases is genetic testing. A genetic test is often ordered due to clinical suspicion related to clinical signs and symptoms, family history, muscle biopsy, and muscle MRI. Muscle biopsy evaluates for changes in the muscle cell that may be associated with mutations in the RYR-1 gene (e.g. CCD, MMD, CNM, CFTD). Muscle MRI allows the physician to evaluate for muscle damage throughout the body, with varying patterns being associated with various forms of muscular dystrophies and myopathies, including subtypes of RYR-1 myopathy.\n', 'The first symptom of MRS is usually swelling of the upper lip, lower lip, one or both cheeks, eyelids, or rarely, one side of the scalp. The first episode may resolve in hours or days, but swelling may be more severe and last longer in subsequent episodes and can become permanent. The enlarged lips may appear cracked and discolored and can be painful. Fever, headache and visual disturbances sometimes occur with an episode. A fissured tongue is seen in 20-40% of those affected and may be present since birth. Salivary gland secretion may be reduced and the sense of taste may be diminished. Facial palsy occurs in about 30% of those affected. It usually occurs after episodes of lip swelling have already occurred but is sometimes the first symptom. The facial palsy can be on one side or both, resolves initially, but can become permanent. MRS is thought to be caused by genetic factors in some cases because families have been described in which multiple members are affected. MRS is sometimes a symptom of another condition such as Crohn’s disease or sarcoidosis. Dietary and other allergens may also be involved. Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome usually begins in young adulthood and affects slightly more females than males. Approximately 300 cases have been reported but the condition may be under-diagnosed because facial palsy is not always present. MRS is diagnosed by physical findings and history. A biopsy of the lips may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis in some cases. Specialized laboratory studies and procedures may be recommended to rule out Crohn’s disease and sarcoidosis.\n', 'A diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and specialized procedures to measure oxidant production by white blood cells. In healthy individuals, the white blood cells produce a chemical oxidant that destroys bacteria. One blood test for diagnosis of CGD uses a molecule called dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) to determine whether or not white blood cells are making these oxidants normally. Oxidants cause the DHR to fluoresce, which is markedly reduced or absent in CGD white blood cells. This test can be performed on blood samples shipped to clinical laboratories certified to perform this test. Another blood test for CGD is called the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) slide test. In this test, NBT is mixed with the white blood cells, which are then activated to produce oxidants that react with NBT, turning it a deep blue color. If this reaction does not occur, then these important oxidants are not being produced by an individual’s white blood cells. If CGD is diagnosed based on defects in blood cell oxidant production, genetic testing is typically recommended to determine the specific type of CGD.\n', 'Testing for meningococcal meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other testing may include examination of the blood and/or skin. Diagnosis is made by laboratory examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that often reveals the presence of bacterial meningitis.\n', 'Hereditary multiple osteochondromas is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic condition. Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary to cause a particular disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent or can be the result of a new mutation in the affected individual. Approximately 10% of cases of HMO are thought to be the result of new mutations. At present two genes, EXT1 and EXT2, are known to show mutations in HMO patients and it is thought that these genes function as tumor suppressors. For some affected individuals no mutation in either gene is detected.  In almost all these cases, the “mutation negative” patients do not have a familial history for exostoses. Most likely, they have an EXT1 or EXT2 mutation in only part of their body cells and the mutation is absent or undetectable in blood cells, which are usually used for DNA analysis.  Data indicates that individuals with EXT1 mutations may have more severe effects than those with EXT2 mutations. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy. The risk is the same for males and females. The prevalence of HMO has been estimated to be about 1 of 50,000 live births. A high prevalence of this disorder has been reported in some isolated communities. Hereditary multiple osteochondromas is a disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers but in general males tend to be more severely affected.\n', 'Tangier disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the blood. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is often referred to as the “good cholesterol” as it can facilitate the removal of cholesterol out of the walls of arteries, particularly the coronary (heart) arteries. Classic features of Tangier disease include fatty accumulations that present as enlarged and yellow- or orange-colored tonsils, or enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes. Tangier disease may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, moderate elevation in triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), nerve disturbances (neuropathy), and rarely an opaqueness in the covering of the eye (corneal clouding). This disorder was originally named after the location in which it was first discovered - Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Later, the disease was further characterized as more individuals were found to have the disease in other areas of the United States and around the globe. Symptoms of Tangier disease are variable and depend on which organs are involved and the severity of those manifestations. Tangier disease is most often characterized by enlarged orange- or yellow-colored tonsils. This discoloration is due to fatty deposits accumulating in the tonsils. Fatty deposits can also form in other organs causing enlargement of the throat, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Fat accumulations in nerves can cause disturbances and loss-of-sensation called peripheral neuropathy. Discoloration may also occur in the digestive system, particularly the rectum and large intestine. Cardiovascular disease has been reported in adults with Tangier disease. In rare cases, a clouding of the cornea of the eye can occur, but is generally mild and does not cause vision impairment. Tangier disease is a rare disorder with only approximately 100 cases diagnosed worldwide. Tangier disease is thought to be present at birth, but the age of diagnosis can be highly variable (from infancy through 7th decade) due to the nature of symptoms.\n', 'Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (TRPS3), also known as Sugio-Kajii syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS3 is characterized by fine, thin light-colored hair; unusual facial features; abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes; and multiple abnormalities of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a pear-shaped or rounded (bulbous) nose; an abnormally long prominent groove (philtrum) in the upper lip; and/or abnormalities such as delayed eruption of teeth. In addition, affected individuals also exhibit severe shortening of the fingers and toes (brachydactyly) due to improper development of bones in the hands and feet (metacarpophalangeal shortening). Additional features often include short stature (dwarfism) and/or additional skeletal abnormalities. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. TRPS3 is thought to have autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. However, of the reported cases, most affected individuals have been female. Approximately 15 cases have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of trichrhinophalangeal syndome type III may be suspected based upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., fine, sparse hair; facial abnormalities; etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and X-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal severe shortening of bones in the hands and feet (i.e., metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges) and the abnormal development of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the phalangeal bones (epiphyseal coning).', 'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is characterized by the development of a tumor (gastrinoma) or tumors that secrete excessive levels of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates production of acid by the stomach. Many affected individuals develop multiple gastrinomas, which are thought to have the potential to be cancerous (malignant). In most patients, the tumors arise within the pancreas and/or the upper region of the small intestine (duodenum). Due to excessive acid production (gastric acid hypersecretion), individuals with ZES may develop peptic ulcers of the stomach, the duodenum, and/or other regions of the digestive tract. Peptic ulcers are sores or raw areas within the digestive tract where the lining has been eroded by stomach acid and digestive juices. Symptoms and findings associated with ZES may include mild to severe abdominal pain; diarrhea; increased amounts of fat in the stools (steatorrhea); and/or other abnormalities. In most affected individuals, ZES appears to develop randomly (sporadically) for unknown reasons. In approximately 25 percent of patients, ZES occurs in association with a genetic syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). All of the tumors are considered to have malignant potential. Prognosis is related to tumor size and the presence of distant metastases. ZES may become apparent at any age. However, symptom onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 60 years. The exact frequency of ZES in the general population is unknown. However, some researchers estimate that ZES represents less than one percent of peptic ulcers.\n', 'PDE is considered to be a rare disease, and only a few epidemiologic studies have been published. For example, a study from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland reported a point prevalence of 1:687,000 for definite and probable cases of PDE, while a survey conducted in the Netherlands reported an estimated birth incidence of 1:396,000. PDE is quite likely under-diagnosed and a higher birth incidence is suspected. This notion is supported by a study from a German center where pyridoxine administration is part of a standard treatment protocol for neonatal seizures and a birth incidence of probable cases of 1:20,000 was reported. While pyridoxine-dependency should be considered when evaluating possible causes of intractable seizures in young patients, other more common causes must be ruled out, including a variety of brain malformation syndromes, serious acquired disorders of the central nevous system (such as hemorrhagic conditions and infections), and other inborn errors of metabolism. A closely related neonatal metabolic epilepsy is PNPO deficiency. Babies with this genetic disorder also have intractable seizures, but the seizures in these patients respond to pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (P5P, the biologically active form of pyridoxine) but in most instances do not respond to pyridoxine. Other genetic pyridoxine-dependency states have been described (e.g. pyridoxine-dependent anemia and pyridoxine-dependent forms of homocystinuria, xanthurenic aciduria and cystathioninuria), but these conditions are not genetically related to PDE, and intractable seizures are not a feature of these other disorders.\n', "Chromosome 18 Ring is a rare disorder in which there is loss (deletion) of genetic material from one or both ends of the 18th chromosome and joining of the chromosomal ends to form a ring.  Associated symptoms and findings may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case, depending upon the amount and location of lost genetic material and other factors. A ring may also be formed without the loss of any genetic material. However, many individuals with the disorder are affected by mental retardation; low muscle tone (hypotonia); growth retardation; repeated infections during the first years of life; and/or malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial features often include an unusually small head (microcephaly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), and/or vertical skin folds that cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds). Chromosome 18 Ring is usually caused by spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in the development of the embryo that appear to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). Since Chromosome 18 Ring was originally described, more than 70 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  In these observed cases, females appear to be affected slightly more often than males.  The disorder is often detected at birth or during prenatal testing.\n", 'Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 male births. It is less prevalent than hemophilia A which occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 male births. Although many hemophilia B carrier females do not have symptoms, an estimated 10-25% will develop mild symptoms and females have also been reported with moderate and severe symptoms. All races and ethnic groups are affected equally. Individuals with severe hemophilia B are usually diagnosed around birth or within the first 1-2 years of life; those with moderate hemophilia B, five to six years of age; and individuals with mild hemophilia B may not be diagnosed until later in life and even into adulthood.\n', 'Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is named after the investigator (PJ Waardenburg) who first precisely described the disorder in 1951. At least 1,400 cases have since been recorded in the medical literature. Evidence suggests that WS may have a frequency of approximately one in 40,000 births and account for about two to five percent of cases of congenital deafness. The disorder appears to affect males and females relatively equally.\n', 'XYY syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra Y chromosome. Normally, males have 46 chromosomes including one X and one Y chromosome. Males with XYY syndrome have 47 chromosomes, two of which are Y chromosomes. Most cases of XYY syndrome are due to a cell division error in the sperm prior to conception. Rarely, the cell division error occurs after conception resulting in a mosiac of cells with 46 chromosomes and 47 chromosomes. The exact cause for why these errors in cell division occur is not understood. XYY syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder present at birth that affects only males. It is estimated to occur in approximately one in 1,000 live births.\n', "Candida Albicans is a normally harmless yeast infection found in the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina. Candidiasis is an infection caused by a fungus called Candida; most commonly the Candida albicans variety. The Candida infection (also known as a yeast infection) usually affects the skin and/or the mucous membranes of the mouth, intestines, or the vagina. Candida infections are rarely serious in otherwise healthy people. In rare cases, it may spread through other parts of the body if the patient's immune system is not functioning properly. In the most severe cases it can affect the blood, the membrane lining the heart muscle (endocardium), or membranes around the brain (meninges). Candidiasis is caused by a normally harmless infection with the yeast fungus of the genus Candida, usually Candida albicans (Monilia albicans).  The yeast is supposed to be present in healthy people.  However, the fungus may multiply in the mouth or the bowels when a patient receives chemotherapy or broad spectrum antibiotics which suppress the bacterial flora which are normally present in the body.  Other health conditions such as pregnancy or diabetes mellitus may also make the patient prone to a Candida infection. Chronic Candidiasis usually affects people who are debilitated by predisposing health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pregnancy or immune deficiencies.  Newborn babies may also be affected with the disorder through maternal infection. People with suppressed immune systems can be affected by a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and viral infections.\n", 'Introduction Both KS and nIHH are relatively rare, can affect both males and females, with a clear male predominance (~4:1). According to a recent retrospective study, to identify all diagnosed KS cases throughout Finland born during a defined time period, the minimal incidence of KS in Finland was approximately 1 in 48,000 newborns. There was a clear difference in estimates between boys (1 in 30,000) and girls (1 in 125,000). The reason for this sex ratio relates in part to the genetics and in part due to a bias of ascertainment wherein males with delayed puberty tend to seek care more frequently than do their female counterparts. A precise estimate of prevalence remains a challenge as there may be differences in different populations.\n', '"Joubert syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the area of the brain that controls balance and coordination. This condition is characterized by a specific finding on an MRI called a ""molar tooth sign"" in which the cerebellar vermis of the brain is absent or underdeveloped and the brain stem is abnormal. The most common features of Joubert syndrome are lack of muscle control (ataxia), abnormal breathing patterns (hyperpnea), sleep apnea, abnormal eye and tongue movements and low muscle tone. The prevalence of Joubert syndrome has been estimated to be 1/258,000 but is probably an underestimate of the true prevalence, which may be closer to 1/100,000. The diagnosis of Joubert syndrome is based on physical symptoms and the ""molar tooth sign"" as seen on an MRI. Molecular genetic testing is available for the four genes that have been shown to cause Joubert syndrome in about 40% of cases. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available if one of these gene mutations has been identified in an affected family member."\n', 'Primary craniosynostosis affects individuals of all races and ethnicities and is usually present at birth. Most forms of primary craniosynostosis affect men and women in equal numbers (although males outnumber females 2:1 for sagittal synostosis). Primary craniosynostosis affects approximately 0.6 in 100,000 people in the general population. Overall, craniosynostosis affects approximately 1 in 2,000-2,500 people in the general population. Approximately 80-90 percent of individuals with primary craniosynostosis have isolated defects. The remaining cases of primary craniosynostosis occur as part of a larger syndrome. More than 150 different syndromes have been identified that are potentially associated with craniosynostosis.\n', 'Progeria, or Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), is a rare, fatal, genetic condition of childhood with striking features resembling premature aging. Children with progeria usually have a normal appearance in early infancy. At approximately nine to 24 months of age, affected children begin to experience profound growth delays, resulting in short stature and low weight. They also develop a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a disproportionately small face in comparison to the head; an underdeveloped jaw (micrognathia); malformation and crowding of the teeth; abnormally prominent eyes; a small nose; prominent eyes and a subtle blueness around the mouth. In addition, by the second year of life, the scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are lost (alopecia), and the scalp hair may be replaced by small, downy, white or blond hairs. Additional characteristic features include generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, hip dislocations, unusually prominent veins of the scalp, loss of the layer of fat beneath the skin (subcutaneous adipose tissue), defects of the nails, joint stiffness, skeletal defects, and/or other abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, individuals with HGPS develop premature, widespread thickening and loss of elasticity of artery walls (arteriosclerosis), which result in life-threatening complications during childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Children with progeria die of heart disease (atherosclerosis) at an average age of 13 years, with a range of about eight to 21 years. As with any person suffering from heart disease, the common events as heart disease advances for children with progeria can include high blood pressure, strokes, angina (chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart itself), enlarged heart, and heart failure, all conditions associated with aging. HGPS is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females equally, and all races equally. The disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1886 (J. Hutchinson) and 1897 (H. Gilford). As of January 2014, approximately 200 cases have been reported. Estimates indicate that the prevalence of HGPS is approximately one in eighteen million, thus at any given time, there are approximately 350-400 children living with progeria worldwide. Two sets of affected identical twins have been reported in the literature.\n', '"Reactive arthritis is a general term for a form of joint inflammation (arthritis) that develops as a ""reaction"" to an infection in another area of the body (i.e., outside of the joints). Joint inflammation is characterized by redness, swelling, pain and warmth in and around the affected joint. In reactive arthritis, the large joints of the lower limbs and the sacroiliac joints are most often affected. Two other common symptoms of reactive arthritis are inflammation of the urinary tract and inflammation of the membrane (conjunctiva) that lines the eyelids (conjunctivitis). These three characteristic symptoms may occur separately, all at once or not at all. Additional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, lower back pain and heel pain may also occur. Reactive arthritis usually develops following a bout with certain bacterial infections including Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter."\n', 'HSAN IV affects males and females in equal numbers. Several hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. More cases have been reported in Japan than any other country and the frequency of the disorder is higher in the Japanese and Israeli-Bedouin populations due to a founder effect. A founder effect is when a small isolated population of settlers (founders) expands over several generations leading to a high prevalence of a particular genetic trait. Onset of the disorder is at birth.\n', 'Frontotemporal degeneration is the second most common form of dementia in people under the age of 65 after Alzheimer’s disease. The mean age of onset is usually given as the late 50s, with an age range of 20-80. However, onset before 40 or after 75 is less common. Frontotemporal degeneration is estimated to affect about 50,000-60,000 people in the United States. Researchers believe that many people go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with another condition. This makes it difficult to determine the true frequency of frontotemporal degeneration in the general population.\n', 'WNT4 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that affects females. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown and it has only been identified in several women worldwide. Researchers believe that cases of WNT4 deficiency may often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. WNT4 deficiency is present at birth (congenital), but can go unidentified until adolescence.\n', 'Syringomyelia most commonly presents in young adults between 20 and 40 years of age, but can also develop in young children or older adults. Some reports suggest that syringomyelia is slightly more common in males than females. One estimate places the incidence at 8.4 individuals per 100,000 in the general population in the United States.\n', 'Binswanger disease is caused by arteriosclerosis, thromboembolism and other diseases that obstruct blood vessels that supply the deep structures of the brain. Hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for Binswanger disease. Rare hereditary diseases such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) also cause Binswanger disease. Thus, Binswanger disease is actually a clinical syndrome of vascular dementia with multiple causes, not a specific disease. The reduced blood flow in brain tissue appears to produce secondary inflammation that may be a target for treatment. Binswanger disease affects males and females in equal numbers and usually occurs in individuals age 50 years or older. The diagnosis of Binswanger disease is usually based on a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history, physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the brain. MRI and CT reveal nerve fiber (white matter) degeneration and multiple small strokes in the deep structures of the brain.\n', 'The exact cause of CIDP is unknown but there are strong indications that CIDP is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body’s natural defenses (antibodies and lymphocytes) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue. The cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. CIDP is a rare disorder that can affect any age group and the onset of the disorder may begin during any decade of life. CIDP affects males twice as often as females (M2:F1) and the average age of onset is 50. The prevalence of CIDP is estimated to be around 5-7 cases per 100,000 individuals. CIDP can be difficult to diagnose. The symptoms must be present for at least two months and symmetric proximal and distal weakness with reduced or absent tendon reflexes are highly suggestive of CIDP. Tests that can be of diagnostic help include nerve conduction testing and electromyography looking for very slow nerve conduction velocities, lumbar puncture looking for elevated spinal fluid protein without many inflammatory cells and MRI imaging of the nerve roots looking for enlargement and signs of inflammation.\n', 'Ollier disease is a rare skeletal disorder characterized by abnormal bone development (skeletal dysplasia). While this disorder may be present at birth (congenital); it may not become apparent until early childhood when symptoms, such as deformities or improper limb growth, are more obvious. Ollier disease primarily affects the long bones and cartilage of the joints of the arms and legs, specifically the area where the shaft and head of a long bone meet (metaphyses). The pelvis is often involved; and even more rarely, the ribs, breast bone (sternum), and/or skull may also be affected. Ollier disease is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Symptoms are most often observed in children but can occur in adolescents and adults.  This disorder can affect all races. Methods of diagnosing Ollier disease include bone biopsy, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and recording of internal body images (tomography). Surgical correction of deformities of the affected limb(s) has been helpful. In severe cases, artificial (prosthetic) joint replacement may becom. necessary. Fractures routinely heal without complications. Affected individuals should be checked routinely by a physician for malignant changes in the bones and joints (e.g., chondrosarcoma).\n', 'Spina bifida is characterized by incomplete closure of certain bones of the spinal column (vertebrae), leaving a portion of the spinal cord exposed. Part of the contents of the spinal canal may protrude through this opening. In the most severe form, rachischisis, the opening is extensive. Spina bifida may cause difficulties with bladder control, walking and/or other functions, depending on the severity of associated symptoms. Spina bifida is the most common neural tube defect in the United States. Between 1,500 and 2,000 babies out of about 4 million births are born with this disorder each year in the United States. Spina bifida is usually an isolated birth defect but it can also occur as part of a syndrome with other birth defects.  It is one of a group of disorders known as neural tube defects.\n', 'NMOSD occurs in individuals of all races. The prevalence of NMOSD is approximately 1-10 per 100,000 individuals and seems to be similar worldwide, although somewhat higher rates have been reported in countries with a higher proportion of individuals of African ancestry. Relative to MS that it mimics, it occurs with greater frequency in individuals of Asian and African descent, but the majority of patients with this illness in Western countries are Caucasian. Individuals of any age may be affected, but typically NMOSD, especially cases seropositive for AQP4-IgG, occur in late middle-aged women. Equal numbers of men and women have the form that does not recur after the initial flurry of attacks, but women, especially those with AQP4-IgG, are four or five times more likely to be affected than men by the recurring (relapsing) form. Children represent may also be affected by this condition; children more commonly develop brain symptoms at onset and seem to have a higher frequency of monophasic presentation than adults. A diagnosis of NMOSD is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests include blood tests, examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), spinal taps, or x-ray procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) or computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans. A blood test, AQP4-IgG, is highly specific and moderately sensitive for NMOSD. It has been shown that it detects antibodies that are specific for an astrocyte protein, aquaporin-4. This is very helpful to request this test at the first significant suspicion of NMOSD, as it is frequently positive at the time of the very first symptom even before a confident clinical diagnosis is possible.  A recently discovered antibody, MOG-IgG, is present in about half of those who do not have AQP4-IgG; while it seems specific for a form of NMOSD, and is rarely seen in typical MS, it also occurs in some patients with recurrent optic neuritis and in some patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; in the latter patients, it is often transient. Successful diagnosis of NMOSD depends on distinguishing it from MS.\n', 'Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system that is associated with abnormalities of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. It is one of the leukodystrophies in which disease is due to abnormal development of one or more components (predominantly fats or proteins) that make up the white matter (myelin sheath) of the brain. The myelin sheath is the protective covering of the nerve and nerves cannot function normally without it. In PMD, many areas of the central nervous system may be affected, including the deep portions of the cerebrum (subcortical), cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. Signs may include the impaired ability to coordinate movement (ataxia), involuntary muscle spasms (spasticity) that result in slow, stiff movements of the legs, delays in reaching developmental milestones, late onset loss of motor abilities, and progressive deterioration of intellectual function. The neurologic signs of PMD are usually slowly progressive.\n', 'Pemphigus and pemphigoid are rare autoimmune blistering diseases of the skin and/or mucous membranes. Pemphigus affects the outer of the skin (epidermis) and causes lesions and blisters that are easily ruptured. Pemphigoid affects a lower layer of the skin, between the epidermis and the dermis, creating tense blisters that do not break easily. Sometimes pemphigoid may look like hives or eczema without blisters. Pemphigus and pemphigoid are not genetic (hereditary) though there can be a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. A person who is genetically predisposed to a disorder carries a gene (or genes) for the disease, but it may not be expressed unless it is triggered or “activated” under certain circumstances, such as due to particular environmental factors.  It is not currently possible to predict who may get these diseases. Men and women are equally affected. The conditions are known to affect people across racial and cultural lines. However, there are certain groups of people (Ashkenazi Jews, people of Mediterranean, North Indian and Persian decent) who have a higher incidence of the disease.\n', 'The median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a cause of chronic abdominal pain affecting both children and adults alike. Chronic abdominal pain is a very common condition that can have significant negative, long-term psychosocial consequences, including increased risk for anxiety, school and work absences, poor functional capacity, and a poor quality of life. While the exact cause of the pain is unknown, compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm can result in pain that is worsened with eating or sometimes with exercise. Other symptoms include nausea and weight loss. In some patients the symptoms can be devastating and can lead to erroneous diagnoses of an eating disorder, psychiatric conditions, or functional abdominal pain (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal migraine). The diagnosis is made based on a combination of the clinical symptoms and radiology imaging. There is a surgical procedure that can be performed that is effective in approximately 60-80% of patients. Compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament is a poorly understood vascular compression syndrome involving the celiac artery and celiac nerve plexus that results in upper abdominal pain (frequently made worse with eating), weight loss, nausea and vomiting. Sometimes a doctor may hear a soft whooshing sound with a stethoscope (bruit) over the upper abdomen that may mean there is a vascular blockage. Some patients who are athletes may experience recurrent upper abdominal pain that is brought on by moderate to intense cardiovascular work outs. Additional symptoms associated with the diagnosis, but frequently indicative of other medical problems include palpitations (hearing or feeling your own heartbeat), chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, and difficulty sleeping. The characteristic MALS patient is more likely to be young adult female, which is consistent with demographic characteristics of other chronic abdominal pain (CAP) patients. However, given the wide distribution of celiac artery compression, the syndrome affects both young and old as well as women and men.\n', '"The term ""AIDS dysmorphic syndrome"" or ""HIV embryopathy"" has been used by some researchers to describe specific facial malformations (i.e., craniofacial dysmorphism), an unusually small head, and growth deficiency in some infants infected with HIV.* Such craniofacial abnormalities have included a prominent, boxlike forehead, large, wide eyes; a flattened nasal bridge, and an unusually pronounced philtrum, which is the vertical groove in the center of the upper lip. Most new cases of HIV infection in young children (pediatric HIV infection) are caused by transmission from the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding (perinatal transmission).  Estimates suggest that the transmission rate from untreated HIV-positive mothers in the United States is approximately 12 to 30 percent. (For further information, please see the “Standard Therapies” section of this report below.)  Women with HIV infection are most often infected through heterosexual relations with an infected partner or injection drug use. Perinatal HIV infection is thought to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  As noted above, in some cases, certain dysmorphic features have been observed prior to the onset of symptoms associated with immunodeficiency.  However, the significance of such observations has been questioned (see “Symptoms”).  Symptoms and findings resulting from immunodeficiency may become apparent during the first or second year of life or later during childhood. Perinatal HIV infection is considered in infants of mothers known to be HIV-positive and/or in infants and children who have certain characteristic symptoms of HIV infection or immune system abnormalities. Infants who are born to mothers with HIV have antibodies against the virus in the bloodstream at birth (passively acquired maternal antibodies). In infants and children who are not infected with HIV, these passive antibodies eventually disappear, usually between six to 12 months, however, in some cases, they may be detectable for up to 18 months. Therefore, testing that detects the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood (serum antibody tests, e.g., enzyme immunoassay and confirmatory Western blot) in a child 18 months or older usually indicates infection; however, such testing is not conclusive in children younger than 18 months. In these children, HIV infection may be confirmed through the repeated use of various specialized viral detection laboratory tests (e.g., HIV viral cultures, a DNA-amplification and copying method known as polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). Additional laboratory tests may also be conducted to assess immune functioning in order to assist in diagnosis and to monitor disease progression and its treatment. Testing may include monitoring of helper T cell numbers (CD4+ cells), the ratio of helper T cells to certain other white blood cells (CD8+ cells), complete blood counts, and blood platelet levels."\n', 'Congenital hypomyelination neuropathy (CHN) is a neurological disorder present at birth. Major symptoms may include respiratory difficulty, muscle weakness and incoordination, poor muscle tone (neonatal hypotonia), absence of reflexes (areflexia), difficulty in walking (ataxia), and/or impaired abilities to feel or move part of the body. Symptoms of congenital hypomyelination neuropathy and the severity of these symptoms vary from patient to patient.  Major symptoms can include delayed motor (muscle) development (ability to turn over, stand, crawl, walk, etc.), muscle weakness, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), impaired muscle coordination, absence of reflexes (areflexia), difficulty in walking or crawling, and/or impaired ability to feel or move part of the body (mild distal palsy).  In some infants, respiratory problems or difficulty in swallowing may occur. Abnormal microscopic changes in certain nerves such as sural nerves (located in the calf of the leg) can occur. Congenital hypomyelination neuropathy is a rare disorder present at birth. It affects males and females in equal numbers. Testing for congenital hypomyelination neuropathy includes measuring the velocity of transmission of electrical impulses produced by the muscles (electromyogram), as well as nerve and/or muscle biopsies.\n', 'Meningococcemia is a rare infectious disease characterized by upper respiratory tract infection, fever, skin rash and lesions, eye and ear problems, and possibly a sudden state of extreme physical depression (shock) which may be life-threatening without appropriate medical care. There are two forms of meningococcemia. Fluminant meningococcemia develops very rapidly and is more severe than chronic meningococcemia, which has a waxing and waning course. Meningococcemia affects males and females in equal numbers.  However, most cases develop in persons twenty years of age or younger and half of these cases are in children under five years of age.  In the United States 1.2 cases per 100,000 occur annually.   Winter and spring are the most common seasons of the year when cases are reported.  Epidemics can occur under crowded conditions and tend to occur at 20 to 30 year intervals.  In other parts of the world epidemics are usually caused by the Group A strain of the bacteria. During epidemics, rates of 5 to 24 cases per 100,000 persons have occurred. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, during 1974 the epidemic rate was 370 per 100,000 persons infected with Meningococcemia.  In the United States, the most prevalent Group strains of the bacteria are B,C,Y, and W-135. The diagnosis of Meningococcemia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized blood tests.\n', 'Familial iFamilial isolated hypoparathyroidism is a group of extremely rare genetic disorders characterized by parathyroid glands that do not produce or secrete enough parathyroid hormone to maintain normal mineral balance. The parathyroid glands are part of the endocrine system, the network of glands that regulate the chemical processes within the body. Parathyroid hormone plays a vital role in regulating the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. Parathyroid hormone deficiency causes low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) and high levels of phosphorous. Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism, with the exception of the X-linked form, affects males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked form affects males almost exclusively. The exact incidence and prevalence of these disorders in the general population is unknown. Some mild cases may go unrecognized, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of these disorders.\n', 'ADPKD affects males and females in equal numbers. Although a head-count has never been done, autopsy records show that between 1 in 400-1,000 people in the general population had ADPKD. There are approximately 6,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Approximately 6-10 percent of individuals receiving dialysis and renal transplant treatments in the United States have ADPKD. ADPKD is estimated to affect approximately 200,000 to 600,000 in the United States and another 12,000,000 people million worldwide, but only about one-fourth may know they have the disease.\n', "Gerstmann syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can occur as the result of a brain injury or as a developmental disorder. The syndrome is characterized by the loss or absence of four cognitive abilities- the loss of the ability to express thoughts in writing (agraphia, dysgraphia), to perform simple arithmetic problems (acalculia), to recognize or indicate one's own or another's fingers (finger agnosia), and to distinguish between the right and left sides of one's body. Additional cognitive defects may occur in some cases. Gerstmann syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Gerstmann syndrome in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Dr. Josef Gerstmann, a Viennese neurologist, in 1924. The presence in the adult of all four neurological symptoms suggests a diagnosis of Gerstmann syndrome, especially when other causes of these symptoms are ruled out. Among children, most cases are recognized at school age when the affected person has difficulty in math and writing. Affected children may also have problems in spelling, performing the basic four mathematical calculations, and distinguishing left from right. Also, they generally fail the finger identification test. Many, but not all such children will find it difficult to copy simple drawings (constructional apraxia).\n", 'CTD is estimated to account for 1-2% of all unexplained X-linked intellectual disabilities. It is the most common of the three cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes. Children with CTD are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.\n', 'Wilms’ tumor is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in young children. It is responsible for 95% of all malignant kidney tumors in patients under the age of 15 years old. Wilms’ tumor can occur in one kidney (unilateral) or in both kidneys (bilateral) and can spread throughout the rest of the body. There are about 650 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States with the average age of diagnosis being 2 to 5 years of age. Wilms’ tumor is the most common pediatric kidney cancer, and the fourth most common pediatric cancer overall. Wilms’ tumor affects approximately 1 in 10,000 children with the median age of onset being 3.5 years. Girls are slightly more likely than boys to develop Wilms’ tumor and African Americans are also at a higher risk.\n', 'Mallory-Weiss syndrome refers to a tear or laceration of the mucous membrane, most commonly at the point where the esophagus and the stomach meet (gastroesophageal junction). Such a tear may result in severe bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. The immediate cause of the lesion is usually a protracted period of vomiting. In most instances, the immediate cause of Mallory-Weiss syndrome is severe vomiting.  This can be associated with chronic alcoholism, but MWS may also result from a severe trauma to the chest or abdomen, chronic hiccups, intense snoring, lifting and straining, inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis) or esophagus (esophagitis), hiatus hernia, convulsions or CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may develop this disorder as a complication of chemotherapy. Mallory-Weiss syndrome accounts for 1 to 15% of all gastrointestinal bleeding episodes.  However, it occurs more frequently in individuals with alcoholism.  MWS appears to affect more males then females.  The ages of those affected varies considerably, with a peak at ages 40 through 60.  However, some cases have been reported in children. The diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss syndrome is usually determined by endoscopic examination of the esophagus membrane.\n', 'Ichthyosis is a general term for a family of rare genetic skin diseases characterized by dry, thickened, scaling skin. The various forms are distinguished from one another by: 1) extent of the scaling and how widely and where the scaling is scattered over the body; 2) the presence or absence and intensity of reddening of the skin (erythroderma); 3) the mode of inheritance; and 4) the character of associated abnormalities. All the ichthyoses are rare disorders.  Incidences vary according to disease type.  The ichthyoses occur in all populations.  Most forms are not bounded by gender, race or ethnicity.\n', 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by paralysis of the facial nerve (facial palsy) and a rash affecting the ear or mouth. Ear abnormalities such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss may also be present. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox in children and shingles (herpes zoster) in adults. In cases of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, previously inactive (dormant) varicella-zoster virus is reactivated and spreads to affect the facial nerve. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles. The virus can remain dormant for decades in a person who has had chickenpox as a child. Reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus results in shingles and, in some cases, develops into Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The reason why the virus reactivates and affects the facial nerve in Ramsay Hunt syndrome is unknown.\n', 'Idiopathic nodular panniculitis is a rare spectrum of skin disorders characterized by single or multiple, tender or painful bumps below the surface of the skin (subcutaneous nodules) that usually lead to inflammation of the subcutaneous layer of fat (panniculitis). These nodules tend to be 1-2 centimeters large and most often affect the legs and feet (lower extremities). In most cases, idiopathic nodular panniculitis is associated with fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), muscle pain (myalgia), and/or abdominal pain. These symptoms may subside after a few days or weeks and may recur weeks, months, or years later. The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is not known (idiopathic). The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is unknown. There are numerous different causes that may be associated with the development of panniculitis including gout, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, iodide or bromide therapy, withdrawal from large doses of corticosteroids, or pancreatitis. Sometimes the cause may be identified as an allergy or possibly a predisposition of fatty tissue to a granulomatous reaction. A diagnosis of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of classic symptoms. In many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of deep skin tissue may reveal inflammation of subcutaneous layers of fat tissue.\n', 'Trigeminal neuralgia affects females slightly more often than males. Although the exact incidence is unknown, approximately 10,000-15,000 new cases occur each year in the United States. The disorder most frequently affects individuals more than 50 years of age. However, cases can occur in younger adults as well. In younger individuals, the cause is often idiopathic, but when compared to older adult cases  are more likely to be caused by damage to the central nervous system as in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Although extremely rare, TN can occur in children.\n', 'Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by small, red bumps or blisters (papules or nodules) that eventually erode to form swollen open sores (ulcerations). The size and depth of the ulcerations vary greatly, and they are often extremely painful. In approximately 50 percent of cases, PG occurs secondary to another disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease. The exact cause of PG is unknown (idiopathic). Some researchers believe it may be an autoimmune disorder. Pyoderma gangrenosum affects women slightly more often than men. It occurs most often between the ages of 20 to 50 years. Infants or adolescents account for fewer than 4 percent of cases. One estimate places the incidence of PG at 1 in every 100,000 people in the United States. No specific diagnostic tests exist for pyoderma gangrenosum. Diagnosis is made by excluding similar disorders based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed a patient history and a variety of tests such as surgical removal and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue (biopsy).\n', 'Weill Marchesani syndrome is a rare genetic disorder of connective tissue characterized by abnormalities of the lens of the eye, short stature, an unusually short, broad head (brachycephaly) and joint stiffness. The eye (ocular) abnormalities can include small round lenses (microspherophakia), abnormal position of the lens (ectopia lentis) nearsightedness (myopia) resulting from the abnormal shape of the eye and lens and eye disease that damages the optic nerve (glaucoma) that can lead to blindness. Heart defects are present in some affected individuals. Weill Marchesani syndrome follows autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance. Weill Marchesani syndrome is a very rare disorder. The prevalence has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000.\n', 'Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD) is a rare, inherited, skin disorder. KFSD is characterized by hardening of the skin (keratosis) on several parts of the body. Most frequently, the face, neck, and forearms are involved. The thickening of the skin is accompanied by the loss of eyebrows, eyelashes and beard. Baldness (alopecia) usually occurs. People with KFSD may have reduced tolerance to bright light (photophobia), inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis), and inflammation of the outer membrane of the eyeball and the inner eyelid (conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye). Some have abnormal accumulation of material in the clear outer layer of the eye (corneal dystrophy), which may cause loss of vision or blurred vision. Some may also have poor fingernail formation. KFSD is a rare disorder affecting males more severely than females. Because some people with KFSD may go unrecognized or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of these disorders in the general population is difficult. KFSD is estimated to affect about less than 1 in 1,000, 000 people in the general population.\n', 'Cogan-Reese syndrome is an extremely rare eye disorder characterized by a matted or smudged appearance to the surface of the iris; the development of small colored lumps on the iris (nodular iris nevi); the attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae); and/or increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma). Secondary glaucoma may lead to vision loss. This disorder most frequently appears in young and middle-aged females, usually affecting only one eye (unilateral) and developing slowly over time. Cogan-Reese syndrome is a very rare disorder that predominantly affects females in the middle adult years, although cases have been reported in children. Most affected individuals are white. The male to female ratio ranges from 1:2 to 1:5. A family history usually shows no other affected family members.\n', 'The prevalence of XLRS is approximatley1 in 10,000.\n', 'Free sialic acid storage disorders affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact frequency of these disorders in the general population is unknown. Salla disease has been reported in more than 150 individuals, most from Finland and Sweden. Free sialic acid storage diseases may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population.\n', 'LADD syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorders first description in 1967.\n', 'The exact incidence of Frey syndrome is unknown. The disorder most often occurs as a complication of the surgical removal of a parotid gland (parotidectomy). The percentage of individuals who develop Frey syndrome after a parotidectomy is controversial and reported estimates range from 30-50 percent. In follow-up examinations, approximately 15 percent of affected individuals rated their symptoms as severe. Frey syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of Frey syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a specialized test called the Minor Iodine-Starch Test. During this test, an iodine solution is applied to the affected areas of the face. Then, a starch powder such as corn starch is applied over the iodine solution. Individuals are then given an oral stimulus usually a highly acidic food such as a lemon wedge. In affected individuals, discoloration (usually purple) due to excessive sweating occurs on the affected areas.\n', 'Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep (hypersomnolence), (i.e., up to 20 hours a day); excessive food intake (compulsive hyperphagia); and behavioral changes such as an abnormally uninhibited sexual drive. The disorder primarily affects adolescent males. When awake, affected individuals may exhibit irritability, lack of energy (lethargy), and/or lack of emotions (apathy). They may also appear confused (disoriented) and experience hallucinations. Symptoms of Kleine-Levin syndrome are cyclical. An affected individual may go for weeks or months without experiencing symptoms. When present, symptoms may persist for days to weeks. In some cases, the symptoms associated with Kleine-Levin syndrome eventually disappear with advancing age. However, episodes may recur later during life.\n', 'Trisomy 13 Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of chromosome 13 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In some affected individuals, only a percentage of cells may contain the extra 13th chromosome (mosaicism), whereas other cells contain the normal chromosomal pair.\n', 'JMML accounts for ~ 2-3% of all childhood leukemias. The mean age at diagnosis is 2. Males are affected more often than females by a ratio of approximately 2:1. Studies conducted in Denmark and British Columbia placed the incidence at 1.2 cases per million in children each year. In the UK, a study found a lower incidence rate of 0.6 per million. Childhood leukemia as a whole is estimated to affect approximately 4,000 children each year in the United States.\n', 'In male patients with spastic paraplegia and developmental delay/intellectual disability, the L1CAM syndrome should be considered.\n', "Ménière's Disease is a disorder characterized by recurrent prostrating dizziness (vertigo), possible hearing loss and ringing sounds (tinnitus). It is associated with dilation of the membranous labyrinth (endolymphatic hydrops) in the ear. The onset of Ménière’s Disease most commonly occurs during the fifth decade of life.  However, in some cases, symptoms may become apparent during young adulthood or in elderly individuals.  The disease appears to affect males and females equally.\n", 'Chronic, Erosive Gastritis is characterized by many inflamed lesions in the mucous lining of the stomach. It may be a transitory or a chronic condition lasting for years. Chronic,  Erosive Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach characterized by multiple lesions in the mucous lining causing ulcer-like symptoms.  These symptoms may include a burning and heavy feeling in the pit of the stomach, mild nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weakness.  In severe cases there can be bleeding of the stomach which may result in anemia.  Some people with this disorder, especially chronic aspirin users, may show no apparent symptoms until the disease has advanced.  An accurate diagnosis can be made by physician’s  visual inspection of the stomach using a gastroscope. The exact cause of Chronic, Erosive Gastritis is unknown.  It may be the result of an infection, over indulgence of alcohol, or persistent use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. Stress tends to make symptoms worse.  Crohn’s disease and Sarcoidosis have been known to be factors in some cases of Chronic, Erosive Gastritis, while some cases have no apparent cause at all. Chronic, Erosive Gastritis usually occurs during middle age and is more common in males than females.  Alcoholics and chronic aspirin or ibuprofen users (e.g. people with arthritis) are more susceptible to this disorder.\n', 'CFND is a very rare genetic disorder that affects females more often than males. Females have a more severe form of the disorder.\n', 'The exact cause of achalasia is not known. Some clinical researchers suspect that the condition may be caused by the degeneration of a group of nerves located in the chest (Auerbach’s plexus). It is believed that there may be a rare, inherited form of achalasia, but this is not yet well understood at this time. Achalasia is a rare disorder that typically affects adults between the ages of 25 and 60 years. However, this disorder may occur at any age, including during childhood. Achalasia affects males and females in equal numbers except in cases that appear to reflect an inherited form. In those cases, it appears that males are twice as likely as females to be diagnosed with this disorder. X-ray examination (radiology) is frequently useful in the diagnosis of achalasia. Radiological examination, especially with the use of barium, may show enlargement (dilation) of the esophagus and the retention of food and secretions within the esophagus. Devices that measure fluid pressure (manometers) within the esophagus are used to confirm the diagnosis of achalasia.\n', 'Myocarditis is a rare cause of many common clinical symptoms. For example chest pain and shortness of breath with activity can result from many forms of heart disease and non-cardiac causes. Because the diagnostic tests for cardiac inflammation, magnetic resonance imaging or heart biopsy, are not widely available, the diagnosis is often overlooked. In people who have autoimmune disorders, myocarditis may result from an autoimmune reaction against heart tissues and not a viral infection. In this setting, myocarditis is a part of a more widespread process that may require treatment with medication to suppress the immune system.\xa0 Myocarditis can also exacerbate the cardiac damage from other rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis.\n', 'Diencephalic syndrome is a rare disorder caused by a tumor that is usually located in the diencephalon, a portion of the brain just above the brainstem. The diencephalon includes the hypothalamus and the thalamus. Affected infants and young children may develop symptoms that include the failure to gain weight and grow as would be expected based upon age and gender (failure to thrive) and abnormal progressive thinness and weakness (emaciation). Affected infants and children may behave in an alert, happy and outgoing manner, which is in contrast to their outward appearance. Additional symptoms such as vomiting, vision abnormalities, headaches, and pallor can also develop. Diencephalic syndrome can progress to cause severe, life-threatening complications. Diencephalic syndrome is treated by surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and/or molecular-targeted therapy. The reason for the development of the tumor that causes diencephalic syndrome is unknown. Diencephalic syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1951 by Dr. Russell. Diencephalic syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects both males and females. The incidence and prevalence of this disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder is most often seen in infants or young children, but has also been reported in older children and adults.\n', 'Erythrokeratodermia variabilis is an inherited skin disorder characterized by two features: short-lasting red patches in various sizes and shapes that may involve any part of the body; and thickening of the skin (hyperkeratosis). The hyperkeratosis can either be generalized, or localized as fixed, sharply defined, thickened plaques. The hyperkeratosis may also involve the skin of the palms and soles. Skin lesions are made worse by sudden changes in temperature and friction. The red patches may be accompanied by a burning sensation. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis is a rare inherited disorder of the cornification of the skin, which often presents at birth.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers.  There seems to be no predilection by race or ethnicity. Therapy is symptomatic and focuses on diminishing the build-up of skin (hyperkeratosis). Systemic therapy with oral retinoids is very effective, but has to be carefully monitored because of side effects. Moreover, the treatment is only effective as long as one takes the medication. After stopping treatment, the skin changes reappear within a short period of time. Topical skin care may include emollients and keratolytics such as; urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, propylene glycol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids preparations. Avoiding mechanical irritation of the skin can be beneficial.\n', 'PTS affects males more often than females. The incidence of the disorder is based upon available population studies and is estimated to be approximately 1.64 to 3.00 people per every 100,000 individuals in the general population per year. However, cases of PTS may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. The condition develops most often in young to middle-aged adults, but has been reported in young children and the elderly. Additional conditions or disorders that can cause symptoms similar to those seen in PTS include bursitis, rotator cuff injury or disease, calcific tendonitis, impingement syndromes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cervical disc disease, cervical radiculopathy, mononeuritis monoplex, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, polymyalgica rheumatica, thoracic outlet syndrome, and brachial plexus injury secondary to cancer (neoplastic brachial plexopathy). Adhesive capsulitis, which can develop as a complication of PTS, can develop for other reasons as well. NORD has individual reports on some of these disorders and a general report on peripheral neuropathy. (For more information, choose the specific disorder name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Multiple sulfatase deficiency is a very rare hereditary metabolic disorder in which all of the known sulfatase enzymes (thought to be seven in number) are deficient or inoperative. Major symptoms include mildly coarsened facial features, deafness, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Abnormalities of the skeleton may occur, such as curvature of the spine (lumbar kyphosis) and the breast bone. The skin is usually dry and scaly (ichthyosis). Before symptoms are noticeable, children with this disorder usually develop more slowly than normal. They may not learn to walk or speak as quickly as other children. Multiple sulfatase deficiency is present at birth, although symptoms of this disorder don’t become noticeable until the first or second year of life.  It is a very rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers. Treatment for the symptoms of skeletal abnormalities in multiple sulfatase deficiency is symptomatic and supportive. An orthopedist can provide treatment for curvature of the spine. Dermatologic symptoms (ichthyosis) are treated by applying skin softening (emollient) ointments, preferably plain petroleum jelly. This can be especially effective after bathing while the skin is still moist. Salicylic acid gel is another particularly effective ointment. The skin should be covered at night with an airtight, waterproof dressing when this ointment is used. Lactate lotion can also be an effective treatment.\n', 'Fewer than 100 cases of MVID have been reported in the medical literature. The true prevalence of this disorder is unknown. Most cases become apparent soon after birth, but it is also believed by some that there is a later-onset form that becomes apparent six to eight weeks after birth in infants that, until then, have appeared healthy. MVID affects more females than males with a sex ratio of about 2:1. The diagnosis of MVID may be based upon electron microscopy of a tissue sample (biopsy) from the intestine of an ailing child, which depicts microscopic findings of brush border defects in the villus in association with microvillus inclusions (MIs) usually in villus enterocytes characteristic of the disorder. Genetic testing is available and can confirm the diagnosis. Before a biopsy is performed, other causes of dehydration and diarrhea in infants are ruled out.\n', 'Since FCAS is a newly discovered condition, the actual incidence and prevalence of the disease is difficult to determine at this time.\n', 'PMS was initially described in the medical literature in 1985. Since that time, additional cases have been reported in the literature, with more than 1500 members in the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation membership. Males and females are equally likely to be affected. Based on limited statistical analysis, the occurrence rate has been estimated to fall in the range of 2.5-10 per million births, although this is likely to be a gross underestimate. Due to the subtle appearance of the deletion of chromosome 22 and the relatively mild physical features of affected individuals, diagnosis of PMS is often difficult. Over 30% of individuals with this deletion have required two or more chromosome studies before the deletion is detected. It is likely that there are many individuals who had “normal” chromosome studies at an earlier age but who actually carry this subtle chromosome abnormality.\n', 'Uveitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the part of the eye known as the uvea. Posterior uveitis occurs as an isolated condition or as part of other disease affecting body systems (systemic).  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers.  It can strike at almost any age, although it appears most often to occur between the ages of 20 and 50.  According to one estimate, chronic, non-infectious posterior uveitis affects 175,000 people in the United States and 800,000 people worldwide.  Almost 80% of cases of uveitis affect the front (anterior) portion of the eye. The first step in diagnosis is to determine the role, if any, of other immunological and/or infectious conditions in the development of the disorder. Blood studies for infectious agents such as herpes virus, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis and spirochetes are helpful. Chest x-rays may detect sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. If systemic or central nervous system involvement is present or large cell lymphoma is suspected, neuroimaging studies and lumbar puncture may be used.\n', 'Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection. The exact number of people who develop this infection in the United States is not known because there is no national surveillance of this infection. One estimate based on a study in the San Francisco area placed the incidence at 1.7 people per every 1,000,000 in the general population. Incidence refers to the number of new diagnoses of a disorder in one year. According to the medical literature, the incidence of mucormycosis is increasing. Mucormycosis has been reported all over the world. This infection can potentially affect individuals of any age, including premature newborns.\n', 'Agammaglobulinemia is a group of inherited immune deficiencies characterized by a low concentration of antibodies in the blood due to the lack of particular lymphocytes in the blood and lymph. Antibodies are proteins (immunoglobulins, (IgM), (IgG) etc) that are critical and key components of the immune system. They are essential if the immune system is to do its job of fighting off bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances that threaten the body. The specialized precursor cells that produce gammaglobulins, fail to develop or function properly leading to the deficiency in the number of mature lymphocyte cells called B cells. Primary Agammaglobulinemia is a rare disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males although some females have been affected by certain types of this disorder.\n', 'Corneal dystrophies are a group of genetic, often progressive, eye disorders in which abnormal material often accumulates in the clear (transparent) outer layer of the eye (cornea). Corneal dystrophies may not cause symptoms (asymptomatic) in some individuals; in others they may cause significant vision impairment. The age of onset and specific symptoms vary among the different forms of corneal dystrophy. The disorders have some similar characteristics - most forms of corneal dystrophy affect both eyes (bilateral), progress slowly, do not affect other areas of the body, and tend to run in families. Most forms are inherited as autosomal dominant traits; a few are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Corneal dystrophies affect women and men in equal numbers, except for Fuchs corneal dystrophy which affects women about four times as often as men. The corneal dystrophies can affect individuals of any age. The incidence of corneal dystrophies is unknown. Because some individuals do not have symptoms (asymptomatic), determining the true frequency of these disorders in the general population is difficult. The presence of a corneal dystrophy may be found incidentally during a routine eye examination. A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of tests, such as a slit lamp examination, in which a special microscope (slit lamp) allows a physician to view the eye through high magnification. Some specific corneal dystrophies can be diagnosed with molecular genetic tests even before symptoms develop.\n', 'Senior Løken syndrome (SLS; OMIM #266900) is a rare disorder belonging to the general group of rare diseases called ciliopathies that result in nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. Nephronophthisis is the progressive wasting of the filtering unit of the kidney; it is characterized by cysts that develop in the kidneys during infancy or early childhood. Individuals will also develop symptoms of early-onset retinal dystrophy, a progressive retina disease that damages vision, within the first few years of life. Eventually the individual may experience renal failure and vision loss. Senior Løken syndrome is a very rare disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated that the prevalence is 1/1 million people worldwide. Only a few families with the condition have been described in the medical literature.\n', 'PEPCK deficiency is an extremely rare disorder of carbohydrate metabolism inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A deficiency of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which is a key enzyme in the conversion of proteins and fat to glucose (gluconeogenesis), causes an excess of acid in the circulating blood (acidemia). Characteristics of this disorder are low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), loss of muscle tone, liver enlargement and impairment, and failure to gain weight and grow normally. PEPCK deficiency is extremely rare.  One overview suggests that only 10 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis of PEPCK deficiency can be made shortly after birth by biochemical analysis of fibroblast cells.\n', '"Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p is a very rare chromosomal disorder in which the short arm of the 18th chromosome (18p) appears four times (tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up (karyotype) have two 18th chromosomes, both of which have a short arm (""18p"") and a long arm (""18q""). However, in individuals with Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p, four short arms (18ps) are present in cells of the body rather than the normal two. Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p is a very rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  Approximately 40 cases have been reported in the medical literature."\n', 'The exact cause of primary orthostatic tremor is unknown (idiopathic). Some researchers believe that the disorder is a variant or subtype of essential tremor. Other researchers believe the disorder is a separate entity. Some individuals with primary orthostatic tremor have had a family history of tremor suggesting that in these cases genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder. However, more research is necessary to determine the exact, underlying cause(s) of primary orthostatic tremor. Primary orthostatic tremor affects females slightly more frequently than males. Because many affected individuals of primary orthostatic tremor often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, the disorder is believed by some to be under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population.\n', 'Mumps is an acute viral illness that causes a painful inflammation and swelling of the saliva glands. These glands include the parotid, submaxillary, sublingual and buccal salivary glands. Mumps used to be a common infectious disease of childhood until a vaccine was developed in 1967 to immunize children against the virus that causes the disorder. However, recent outbreaks of mumps among adolescents and young adults have raised questions about lifetime immunity from the vaccine. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that is transmitted through saliva by direct contact, or in the form of airborne droplets from the nose, throat or mouth.  The virus enters the body through the upper respiratory tract. Since 1967 when an effective and safe vaccine was developed, mumps has become uncommon.   It affects males and females in equal numbers.  Among those not immunized, the disease strikes most often in children between the ages of five and fifteen, but adults can also be affected.  In recent years outbreaks of mumps on college campuses in the United States have raised question about long-term immunity from the mumps vaccine.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is trying to determine whether people during specific years should be re-vaccinated.\n', 'Biotinidase deficiency can be diagnosed in newborns through newborn screening. Newborn screening is a special type of screening test that newborns receive to see if they have certain diseases. Because the newborn screen is a screening test, a positive result does not mean that an infant definitely has the disease. Often, a repeat test must be done to confirm the diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is possible after birth by testing for biotinidase activity in the blood. Usually, this is performed when signs and symptoms of BTD become clearer. In some infants, a genetic test may be ordered to identify the specific gene changes (mutation) that are causing BTD. Prenatal testing of sample fluid from the womb for biotinidase activity is available as early as 12 weeks of pregnancy (this includes chorionic villi sampling and amniocentesis).\n', 'Erysipelas is an infection of the upper layers of the skin (superficial). The most common cause is group A streptococcal bacteria, especially Streptococcus pyogenes. Erysipelas results in a fiery red rash with raised edges that can easily be distinguished from the skin around it. The affected skin may be warm to the touch. At one time, erysipelas was thought to affect mostly the face, but recent studies suggest that the distribution of the inflammation is changing since at the present time the legs are involved in almost 80% of cases. The rash may also appear on the arms or trunk. Erysipelas is caused by one of several strains of streptococcus bacteria, or less frequently by a staphylococcus infection.  Streptococci are involved in about 80% of cases. Erysipelas is a fairly common infection that may affect anyone at any age.  It is most common in infants, young children and the elderly, including adults of either sex between ages 60 and 80. The typical erysipelas lesion is so characteristic that its presence is diagnostic.\n', 'Hanhart syndrome is a very rare developmental disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 1 in 20,000 children are affected with this disorder. Approximately 30 cases of Hanhart syndrome were reported in the medical literature from 1932 to 1991. Hanhart syndrome is detected in the neonate (newborn), based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. Signs of Hanhart syndrome may be identified before birth (prenatally) by ultrasonography, a test that creates an image of the fetus by measuring the reflection of sound waves.\n', 'I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. The symptoms of I-cell disease are similar to but more severe than those of Hurler syndrome. The symptoms associated with this disorder typically become obvious during infancy and may include multiple abnormalities of the skull and face and growth delays. I-Cell Disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Siblings of affected infants have a 1 in 4 chance of being affected by this disorder.  Approximately 30 cases of I-Cell Disease have been reported in the medical literature.  This disease appears to be more common in Japan than in other countries.\n', 'The prevalence of alpha-mannosidosis is estimated to be 1 in every 500,000 people in the general population. Alpha-mannosidosis affects men and women in equal numbers and can potentially affect individuals of any ethnic group worldwide.\n', 'Polycystic liver disease is characterized by the growth of more than 10 cysts in the liver, ranging in size from a few millimeters to over 15 cm in diameter. Symptoms usually begin to show in people around 50 years old, as cysts grow in size and number with age [1]. Some people begin to have symptoms in early adulthood and many affected individuals do not have symptoms. The growth and accumulation of cysts can cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and compression of adjacent anatomical structures, leading to abdominal pain and discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), indigestion (dyspepsia), gastro-esophageal reflux, and limited mobility [3-6]. More rarely, liver cysts can also compress the bile duct and lead to yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Compression of the blood vessels of the liver by cysts can lead to accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), bleeding, and high blood pressure in the blood flow from intestines to the liver (portal hypertension) [12-14].  In rare cases, patients can suffer from cyst bleeding (hepatic cyst hemorrhage), or a cyst can be infected by bacteria (hepatic cyst infection), causing pain and fever. Infrequently, large liver cysts may rupture, causing severe abdominal pain. (Van Aerts et al. 2017) Even with the presence of many cysts, the liver of individuals with polycystic liver disease functions normally. Polycystic liver disease affects around one in 100,000 people [1, 2]. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, but most patients with symptoms and with severe disease are women. The suggested cause of this difference is that female sex hormones, such as estrogen, contribute to growth of liver cysts  [1, 3, 7, 13, 17, 22]. Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy are also associated with more severe disease [23-25]. Cysts can begin to grow at any age, but are rare in childhood and more common with age. The age at which symptoms begin to occur varies with individuals, but is usually around 50 years old.\n', 'Warburg Micro syndrome is an extremely rare disorder. As with many rare disorders, the exact incidence or prevalence of this disorder is unknown. The disorder probably goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. Fewer than 100 people with this disorder have been described in the medical literature.\n', 'Apnea is a term used to describe the temporary absence of spontaneous breathing. Infantile apnea occurs in children under the age of one year. Apnea may occur because of neurological impairment of the respiratory rhythm or obstruction of air flow through the air passages. The symptoms of infantile apnea include the stoppage of breathing during sleep, an abnormal bluish discoloration to the skin (cyanosis) and sometimes an unusually slow heartbeat (bradycardia). Infantile apnea may be related to some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Episodes of apnea may decrease with age. However, several forms of adult sleep apnea also exist. The exact cause of infantile apnea is not known.  It may occur as the result of a combination of environmental and developmental factors (multifactoral). In extremely rare cases, central infantile apnea may be familial and affect more family members than would otherwise be expected. Infantile apnea affects males and females in equal numbers and occurs in children less than 1 year old.  Infants who are born prematurely tend to experience episodes of apnea (apnea of prematurity).\n', 'Because of the varied symptoms and presentation of Galloway-Mowat syndrome, there are many disorders that can have overlapping symptoms or similar disease expression.\n', 'Sirenomelia, which is also known as mermaid syndrome, is an extremely rare congenital developmental disorder characterized by anomalies of the lower spine and the lower limbs. Affected infants are born with partial or complete fusion of the legs. Additional malformations may also occur including genitourinary abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, anomalies of the lumbarsacral spine and pelvis and absence or underdevelopment (agenesis) of one or both kidneys. Affected infants may have one foot, no feet or both feet, which may be rotated externally. The tailbone is usually absent and the sacrum is partially or completely absent as well. Additional conditions may occur with sirenomelia including imperforate anus, spina bifida, and heart (cardiac) malformations. Sirenomelia is often fatal during the newborn period. The exact cause of sirenomelia is unknown, most cases occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). Sirenomelia affects males more often than females by a ratio of 2.7-1. The exact incidence is unknown, but sirenomelia is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 60,000 to 100,000 births. Sirenomelia occurs with greater frequency in one twin of identical (monozygotic) twins than it does in fraternal (dizygotic) twins or individuals. A diagnosis of sirenomelia can be made prenatally, most often during the second trimester, by fetal ultrasound. An ultrasound is an exam that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the developing fetus. A fetal ultrasound can detect some of the defects associated with sirenomelia.\n', 'Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the Western world varies. Most of people with the disorder, more 80% in the Western world, do not have any symptoms (asymptomatic). Individuals with symptoms, particularly severe symptoms, are a rarer occurrence in developed countries. Primary hyperthyroidism can occur at any age, but is most likely to affect individuals over 50. The incidence is highest among individuals of African-American heritage, followed by Caucasians. Women are affected about three times more often than men. According to one estimate, about 100,000 people in the United States develop primary hyperparathyroidism each year.\n', 'McCune-Albright syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Precocious puberty is more common in females. The disorder is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. Because the disorder is difficult to diagnose, affected individuals may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of MAS in the general population.\n', 'Acromesomelic dysplasia is an extremely rare, inherited, progressive skeletal disorder that results in a particular form of short stature known as short-limb dwarfism. The disorder is characterized by acromelia and mesomelia. Mesomelia describes the shortening of the bones of the forearms and lower legs relative to the upper parts of those limbs. Acromelia is the shortening of the bones of the hands and feet. Thus, the short stature of affected individuals is the result of unusually short forearms and abnormal shortening of bones of the lower legs. The very short hands, fingers, feet, and toes are characteristic. These findings are apparent during the first years of life. As of 2005, there were about 10 affected individuals of Hunter-Thompson type ADM and about 40 to 50 patients of Maroteaux type AMD reported in the medical literature. The number of cases of Grebe type ADM is not known, but that type is believed to be almost entirely limited to persons living in Brazil.\n', 'Dystonia is a general term for a large group of movement disorders that vary in their symptoms, causes, progression, and treatments. This group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures).\xa0The muscular contractions may be sustained or come and go (intermittent). Movements may be patterned and twisting, and/or in some cases shaking or quivering (tremulous) resembling a tremor. Dystonia may occur or be worsened when an individual attempts a voluntary action. There are many different causes for dystonia. Genetic as well as non-genetic factors can contribute to the development of these disorders. In some cases, the exact, underlying cause is unknown (idiopathic). The most characteristic finding associated with most forms of dystonia is twisting, repetitive movements that affect the neck, torso, limbs, eyes, face, vocal chords, and/or a combination of these muscle groups. Certain forms such as laryngeal dystonia are not associated with abnormal postures. Dystonia causes varying degrees of pain and disability that ranges from mild symptoms that come and go to severe, debilitating symptoms that can significantly affect a person’s quality of life. In some cases dystonia can become progressively worse, while in others it remains unchanged or no longer worsens (plateaus). Dystonia may even spontaneously remit in rare cases. Treatment for dystonia depends upon several factors including the specific subtype present and can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy and surgery. Dystonia can affect individuals of any age, gender, race, or ethnic background. It is estimated that as many as 300,000 people in North America may be affected by the various forms of dystonia. However, because many cases of dystonia go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of dystonia in the general population is difficult. Focal forms of dystonia are approximately 10 times more common than generalized forms.\n', 'Beta thalassemia is relatively rare in the United States, but is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in the world. The incidence of symptomatic cases is estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. The disorder is particularly prevalent in the Mediterranean, Middle East, Africa, central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East. Individuals in other parts of the world whose families are from these regions carry a greater risk of having beta thalassemia.\n', 'Fascioliasis is a rare infectious disorder caused by parasites. These parasites are liver flukes that live in plant-eating animals. Liver flukes can be found on water plants in certain parts of the world. When the parasite invades the liver, bile passages may be blocked. A subdivision of Fascioliasis called Halzoun Syndrome affects the throat (pharynx). This infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment. The disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  The acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  Symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  The latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  Individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  The chronic phase can persist for several years.  Symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness. Fascioliasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worms of the genus Fasciola, of which “Fasciola hepatica”, found in temperate climates, and “Fasciola gigantica”, found in tropical climates, are the most common.  Encysted parasitic larvae of these parasites live on water plants, such as watercress, that may be eaten by man or eaten by animals that subsequently are eaten by man.  Once ingested, the larvae escape from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate across the intestinal wall into the abdominal cavity.  They transform into immature worms and, once they reach the liver, move around for up to six weeks, feeding on liver tissue.  Eventually, they take up residence in the bile ducts, where they cause lesions and chronic liver disease.  Generally, the parasite can be killed by adequate cooking of foods before they are eaten. Liver fluke disease should be suspected if the patient recently spent time in a region where infection is prevalent in animals and/or humans. Patients usually report eating wild watercress, algae, or other aquatic plants. Acute and chronic infection can be confirmed by testing that detects liver fluke-specific antibodies in body fluids. Also, parasite eggs may be detected in the stool at the chronic stage of infection.\n', 'Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a hereditary disorder characterized by an inadequate response to the parathyroid hormone, although the hormone is present in normal amounts. This inadequate response affects bone growth in individuals with Pseudohypoparathyroidism. Affected individuals may also experience headaches, unusual sensations, weakness, easy fatigue, lack of energy, blurred vision, and/or abnormal sensitivity (hypersensitivity) to light. Additional symptoms and findings may include stiffness or cramps in the arms and/or legs, palpitations, and/or abdominal pain. In addition, individuals with Pseudohypoparathyroidism may have an abnormally round face, thick short stature, unusually short fourth fingers, and mental retardation. Hormonal and calcium replacement therapy is often helpful, but the lack of growth may persist. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is characterized by short stature, a round face, short neck, and shortened bones in the hands and feet.  Intelligence usually ranges from low normal to mentally retarded.  Headaches, weakness, tiring easily, lethargy, cataracts and blurred vision or hypersensitivity to light may also be present.  During childhood, seizures may occur.  Teeth with underdeveloped enamel tend to erupt later than normal during infancy.  Levels of calcium in the blood are usually low, while phosphate and the parathyroid hormone are elevated.  Patients with Pseudohypoparathyroidism can lead a normal life. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder that affects more than twice as many females than males. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is treated with the vitamin compound 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, which promotes reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys.\n', 'Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder that affects women who have recently given birth (postpartum) and is characterized by the over-production of breast milk (galactorrhea), lack of ovulation (anovulation), and the absence of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea). In Chiari-Frommel Syndrome, these symptoms persist long (for more than six months) after childbirth. The absence of normal hormonal cycles may result in reduced size of the uterus (atrophy). Some cases of Chiari-Frommel Syndrome resolve completely without treatment (spontaneously); hormone levels and reproductive function return to normal. Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea), and the absence of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and ovulation (anovulatory) for more than 6 months after childbirth.  These symptoms occur even though the mother is not nursing the baby.  The pregnancy which precedes the onset of Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is usually normal, and childbirth and initial lactation are uneventful.  However, normal menstrual periods and ovulation do not resume, and persistent discharge from the nipples occurs, which can sometimes last for years.  Other symptoms may include emotional distress, anxiety, headaches, backaches, abdominal pain, impaired vision, and occasionally obesity.  Women who have Chiari-Frommel Syndrome for a long time may also have a loss of muscle tone in the uterus and diminished uterine size (atrophy). Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects females who have recently given birth (postpartum).\n', 'Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1) is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder. TRPS1 is characterized by thin, sparse scalp hair, unusual facial features, abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes, and multiple abnormalities of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a rounded (bulbous) "pear-shaped" nose, an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), dental anomalies, and/or unusually large (prominent) ears. In most cases, the fingers and/or toes may be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and curved. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit short stature. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. In most cases, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I has autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In those individuals with mild symptoms, a diagnosis may be easily missed or go unreported. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population. Many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of TRPS1 than is actually reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of TRPS1 may be suspected upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., rounded [bulbous] nose; thin, sparse hair; etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and X-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal distinctive abnormalities of the hands and feet (e.g., epiphyseal coning). Molecular genetic testing can reveal mutations of the TRPS1 gene.', 'Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPSID) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by complete or partial lack of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) enzyme. This is one of five enzymes that play a role in the breakdown and removal of nitrogen from the body, a process known as the urea cycle. The lack of the CPSI enzyme results in excessive accumulation of nitrogen, in the form of ammonia (hyperammonemia), in the blood. Affected children may experience vomiting, refusal to eat, progressive lethargy, and coma. CPSID is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The estimated frequency of CPSID is 1 in 150-200,000 births. The estimated frequency of urea cycle disorders collectively is one in 30,000.  However, because urea cycle disorders like CPSID often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of urea cycle disorders in the general population.\n', 'HRAS Costello syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in relatively equal numbers. Approximately 350 affected individuals have been reported worldwide.\n', 'Nager syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence in the general population is unknown. Many cases go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Although rare, Nager syndrome is the most common form of acrofacial dysostosis.\n', 'Sandhoff disease is a lipid storage disorder characterized by a progressive deterioration of the central nervous system.  The clinical symptoms of Sandhoff disease are identical to Tay-Sachs disease. Sandhoff disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by an abnormal gene for the beta subunit of the hexosaminidase B enzyme. This gene abnormality results in a deficiency of hexosaminidase A and B that results in accumulation of fats (lipids) called GM2 gangliosides in the neurons and other tissues. Sandhoff disease is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  This disorder occurs in people of many different ethnic backgrounds.  Sandhoff disease may be more common in the Creole population of northern Argentina, the Metis Indians in Saskatchewan, Canada and individuals of Lebanese ancestry. Sandhoff disease can be diagnosed by performing an enzyme assay to determine activity of the hexosaminidase A and B enzymes.  Affected individuals have absent or reduced activity of both enzymes.  Molecular genetic (DNA) testing is available to determine the specific gene mutation that is present in the beta subunit of the Hexosaminidase B gene and confirm the diagnosis.\n', 'ACDMPV is a very rare disorder. The incidence and prevalence is unknown. More than 200 people with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. However, many infants may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, so determining the true frequency of ACDMPV in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare cancer of the nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinuses. Initial symptoms range from bloody nose, runny nose, double vision, and bulging eye to chronic infections and nasal obstruction. It has been associated with several types of papilloma in the nasal cavity, which are benign, but can give rise to malignancy. Prior irradiation for other cancers has been associated with the development of SNUC in a number of cases, and has been associated with a genetic mutation known to be associated with cancer development. Most patients have not had prior irradiation, and no other causes have demonstrated to be significant, though some studies have found that woodworkers and nickel factory workers are generally more susceptible to sinonasal malignancy of all types. Symptoms include bloody nose (epistaxis), runny nose (rhinorrhea), bulging eye (exopthalmos/proptosis), double vision (diplopia), nasal obstruction, and nasal infection. There is no regional predilection for SNUC.  It affects people in all countries more or less equally, based on available evidence.  There is approximately a 2:1 male:female prevalence, and the average age from available published studies is 53 years old.  The age range is 14 to 83 years old.\n', 'ATR-X syndrome affects males. More than 200 cases have been reported to laboratories conducting molecular genetic testing. However, because this disorder is underdiagnosed it is difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Female carriers of the mutated gene do not usually develop any manifestations.\n', 'Factor VII deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 500,000 individuals in the general population. However, many cases of factor VII deficiency go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. The incidence of factor VII deficiency tends to be higher in countries where marriage to close relatives (consanguineous marriage) is more common. According to the medical literature, more than 200 cases of true factor VII deficiency have been reported. Because of the variable severity of factor VII deficiency, the age of presentation can vary widely from birth until adulthood.\n', '"C syndrome, also known as Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, is a rare disorder transmitted as a result of ""gonadal mosaicism"". Mosaicism refers to a condition in which a person has cells that differ from each other in genetic makeup. The difference is usually a variation in the number of chromosomes. Normally, all body cells would have 46 chromosomes, but in mosaicism, some cells may have 45 or 47. Mosaicism occurs as a result of an error in cell division very early in fetal development. Only about 70 cases have been reported in the world’s medical literature.  C syndrome is a very rare disorder that seems to affect males and females in equal numbers."\n', 'Polymyalgia rheumatica is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by muscle pain (myalgia), stiffness, and additional generalized systemic symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, and/or a general feeling of ill health (malaise). Polymyalgia rheumatica can be a relatively benign condition that is extremely responsive to treatment. In some rare cases, permanent muscle weakness, degeneration and loss (atrophy) of muscle mass, and disability may occur. The exact cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, although immunological factors and familial tendencies (genetic predisposition) have been mentioned in the medical literature. The diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica may be confirmed by a thorough clinical examination including a detailed patient history and specialized blood testing that demonstrates an abnormally elevated sedimentation rate. Other substances in the blood, such as serum albumin, globulins, and fibronogen, may also be elevated. Microscopic and laboratory examination of muscle tissue samples (biopsy) from affected individuals does not usually reveal any muscle abnormality. Some people with this disorder may also be anemic. Rheumatoid factor is not present in the blood of people with this disorder.\n', 'No laboratory tests exist to make a definitive diagnosis of benign essential blepharospasm. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms.\n', 'Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare disorder characterized by impaired brain function (encephalopathy). The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder or a disorder in which there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system. Affected individuals have the presence of antithyroid antibodies in their body. Antibodies are part of the immune system; they are specialized proteins that target foreign or invading organisms. Antithyroid antibodies are ones that mistakenly target thyroid tissue. However, it is unclear whether these antibodies play any role in the development of Hashimoto encephalopathy or are a coincidental finding. The main signs and symptoms are related to the encephalopathy. The onset of impaired brain function is rapid (acute), while other times it can develop slowly over many years. The specific symptoms, severity, and course of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. The disorder often responds to therapy with corticosteroids. Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare disease that affects women more often than men. The disorder is estimated to affect 2.1 per 100,000 individuals in the general population. It can affect children, but only approximately 60 affected children have been described in the medical literature. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Multiple pterygium syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by minor facial anomalies, short stature, vertebral defects, multiple joints in a fixed position (contractures) and webbing (pterygia) of the neck, inside bend of the elbows, back of the knees, armpits and fingers. Multiple pterygium syndrome usually follows autosomal recessive inheritance but can also follow autosomal dominant inheritance. Multiple pterygium syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder that affects males and females equally.  There have been approximately fifty cases of this disorder reported in the medical literature.  Multiple pterygium syndrome has been found in Germany, France and England.\n', 'Hypokalemia is a metabolic imbalance characterized by extremely low potassium levels in the blood. It is a symptom of another disease or condition, or a side effect of diuretic drugs. The body needs potassium for the contraction of muscles (including the heart), and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). Potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. The normal concentration of potassium in the body is regulated by the kidneys through the excretion of urine. When the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. Body chemicals and hormones such as aldosterone also regulate potassium balance. Secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced Hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. When Hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium. Hypokalemia may affect both males and females.  However, it occurs more commonly in females. The underlying cause of Hypokalemia must first be treated. When the hypokalemia is severe, potassium chloride may be administered orally or intravenously. Treatment must be carefully monitored by a physician. Any associated acid-base disorders or hormonal disturbances must be evaluated before treatment is planned. The administration of potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics is usually discouraged in patients with kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system. The imbalance of external and internal potassium levels in these individuals may predispose them to life-threatening degrees of Hyperkalemia (too much potassium). Hypokalemia in individuals with high blood pressure taking diuretics may be improved by replacing lost potassium in the diet through certain fruits or potassium drugs. Hypokalemia may also be minimized by dietary restriction of salt since high rates of sodium excretion promote urinary potassium losses. People who participate in vigorous sports or exercise in warm weather should be sure to replace potassium that is lost through excessive sweating. This can be accomplished through dietary planning.\n', 'Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, making up about 80% of people with acute leukemia. In the United States, it is estimated that 3-5 people per every 100,000 people in the general population has the disease. More than half the people diagnosed with AML are 65 years of age or older. Slightly more men than women are affected by the disease, and it occurs with slightly more frequency in people of European heritage.\n', 'Hers disease is a genetic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme, liver phosphorylase. This enzyme is necessary to break down (metabolize) glycogen, a carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscle and used for energy. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the abnormal accumulation of glycogen in the body. Hers disease is one of a group of disorders known as the glycogen storage disorders. It is characterized by enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), moderately low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), elevated levels of acetone and other ketone bodies in the blood (ketosis), and moderate growth retardation. Symptoms are not always evident during childhood, and children are usually able to lead normal lives. The incidence of glycogen storage diseases is estimated to be between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 25,000 persons in the United States. The incidence of Hers disease is unknown, although the disorder has a higher prevalence in the Mennonite population. Symptoms of Hers disease are usually not noticed until adulthood although the disorder may present in childhood. A diagnosis of Hers disease is based on a test for activity of the liver phosphorylase enzyme. A small fragment of liver tissue is surgically removed (biopsy) and assayed for the activity of the enzyme. In persons with Hers disease, this enzyme activity will be reduced.\n', '"WAGR syndrome/11p deletion syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome in which there is a predisposition to several conditions, including certain malignancies, distinctive eye abnormalities, and/or intellectual disability. ""WAGR"" is an acronym for the characteristic abnormalities associated with the syndrome. The acronym stands for (W)ilms\' Tumor, the most common form of kidney cancer in children; (A)niridia, partial or complete absence of the colored region of the eye(s) (iris or irides); (G) Genitourinary abnormalities, such as undescended testicles or hypospadias in males, or internal genital or urinary anomalies in females; and Mental (R)etardation (intellectual disability). A combination of two or more of these conditions is usually present in most individuals with WAGR syndrome/11p deletion syndrome. The clinical picture varies, depending upon the combination of associated abnormalities. WAGR syndrome/11p deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is thought to affect males more frequently than females. Because some affected individuals have external genitalia that strongly resembles that of the opposite sex, incorrect sex identification may occur initially"\n', 'Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by narrowing and obstruction (occlusion) of the veins of the liver (hepatic veins). Symptoms associated with Budd Chiari syndrome include pain in the upper right part of the abdomen, an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly), and/or accumulation of fluid in the space (peritoneal cavity) between the two layers of the membrane that lines the stomach (ascites). Additional findings that may be associated with the disorder include nausea, vomiting, and/or an abnormally large spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of the disorder varies from case to case, depending upon the site and number of affected veins. In some cases, if the major hepatic veins are involved, high blood pressure in the veins carrying blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract back to the heart through the liver (portal hypertension) may be present. In most cases, the exact cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome is unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Most cases tend to affect individuals between the ages of twenty and forty. A diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. A procedure in which a radiographic dye is administered into the body to allow for x-rays of the blood vessels (angiography) is often used to aid diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) and ultrasound are also used as diagnostic procedures. During MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves are used to create cross-sectional images of organs and structures in the body. Surgical removal and microscopic evaluation of liver tissue (biopsy) may be helpful in diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome.\n', 'Pompe disease occurs in various populations and ethnic groups around the world. Estimates vary, but its incidence is generally placed at approximately 1 in 40,000 births in the United States. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Not all people with Pompe disease are readily diagnosed. In the past few years, several people with Pompe disease have been identified with screening programs among patients with undiagnosed limb-girdle dystrophies and/or hyper CK-emia of unknown cause (high level of creatine kinase in the blood is often indicative of muscle damage).\n', 'Hallermann-Streiff syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Hallermann-Streiff syndrome may be suspected shortly after birth or during the first year of life by the identification of characteristic physical findings and symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by thorough clinical evaluation; a detailed patient history; and specialized tests (e.g., radiographic, ophthalmologic, and dental studies) that may help to detect and characterize the abnormalities associated with this disorder. Congenital cataracts with unusually small eyes (microphthalmia) are important findings for the initial diagnosis of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, but other disorders must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis, and this is best accomplished through whole exome sequencing given the extensive differential diagnosis, which includes a number of autosomal recessive disorders.\n', 'Cicatricial alopecias are classified as primary or secondary. This discussion is confined to the primary cicatricial alopecias, in which the hair follicle is the target of a destructive inflammatory process. In secondary cicatricial alopecias, destruction of the hair follicle is incidental to a non-follicle-directed process or external injury, such as severe infections, burns, radiation, or tumors. The cause of the various cicatricial alopecias is not well understood. However, all types of cicatricial alopecias involve inflammation directed at the upper part of the hair follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous gland (oil gland) are located. If the stem cells and sebaceous gland are destroyed, there is no possibility for regeneration of the hair follicle, leading to permanent hair loss. Cicatricial alopecias are not contagious.\n', 'The exact prevalence of NBCCS is unknown. The figure most quoted in the medical literature is 1 individual per 57,000 people in the general population. This figure was based upon a population study in the United Kingdom. However, the authors of that study have revised that figure to approximately 1 in 30,000. The true prevalence of NBCCS in the general population may actually be higher because individuals, especially mild ones, can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. NBCCS affects males and females in equal numbers. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin (including isolated cases not associated with NBCCS) is the most common form of cancer in humans.\n', 'Protein C deficiency affects men and women in equal numbers. The prevalence of the milder form is about 1 in 200-500 people in the general population. Prevalence is the number of people in a population that have a disorder at a given time. The prevalence of severe protein C deficiency is about 1 in 500,000-750,000 people in the general population.\n', 'The term olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) has historically been used to describe a group of disorders that affect the central nervous system and are termed neurodegenerative diseases because they result in a progressive deterioration of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. These conditions are characterized by progressive balance problems (disequilibrium), progressive impairment of the ability to coordinate voluntary movements (cerebellar ataxia), and difficulty speaking or slurred speech (dysarthria). OPCA is a group of rare disorders that affects males and females in equal numbers. Because of confusion regarding the naming and classification of these disorders, determining their frequency in the general population is difficult. The frequency of all forms of OPCA has been estimated to be 3-5/100,000 in the United States. A diagnosis of OPCA is a preliminary diagnosis that is made by a thorough clinical examination and identification of characteristic symptoms. Hereditary OPCA can be diagnosed based on a family history of the same condition or by molecular genetic testing for gene mutations known to be associated with the condition. Molecular genetic testing is available for several of the SCAs. A diagnosis of sporadic OPCA is made if hereditary OPCAs and other conditions associated with symptoms of OPCA are ruled out. Testing may include blood work to rule out other conditions, MRI scans of the brain to look for degenerative changes in the brainstem, EMG testing to look at the electrical testing of muscles and nerves and sometimes examination of spinal fluid.\n', 'WRS is an extremely rare genetic disorder that appears to affect males and females relatively equally. WRS has been observed in various ethnic and racial groups. The disorder was initially described as a distinct entity in 1979 (Wiedemann HR) based upon observation of two unrelated individuals as well as previous reports of two affected sisters in 1977 (Rautenstrauch T). More than 35 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature to date.\n', 'HSAN2 affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. HSAN2 may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population.\n', 'The exact cause is not known (idiopathic). Some researchers have speculated that multiple microtrauma to the anterior chest wall may cause the development of Tietze syndrome. Sometimes, the development of the disorder may be preceded by chronic, excessive coughing, vomiting, trauma or impact to the chest, viral or bacterial infections, or surgery to the thoracic area. Tietze syndrome usually affects older children and young adults. Most cases occur before the age of 40, most often during the second or third decade of life. Although rare, Tietze syndrome has been reported in infants, children or the elderly. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. A diagnosis of Tietze syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and exclusion of other causes of chest pain. A variety of tests including electrocardiogram, x-rays, and biopsies may be performed to rule out more serious causes of chest pain including cardiovascular disorders or malignant conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show thickening and enlargement of affected cartilage.\n', 'Pityriasis rosea is a relatively mild skin disorder characterized by a salmon or pink colored, scaly rash. Pityriasis rosea most often affects children and young adults. In many individuals with pityriasis rosea, the characteristic rash develops after vague, nonspecific symptoms that resemble those associated with an upper respiratory infection. The rash is usually located on the back, chest and stomach and resolves on its own within one to three months. Certain treatments may reduce the duration of the rash. Researchers believe that pityriasis rosea is caused by an infectious pathogen, but they have been unable to isolate and identify such a pathogen. Some reports in the medical literature state that pityriasis rosea affects females more often than males; others state that the disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder most commonly affects individuals between the ages of 10 and 35, but has been reported in all age groups including infants and the elderly. Pityriasis rosea occurs with greater frequency in the spring and autumn months. A diagnosis of pityriasis rosea is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. In the earlier stages of the disorder, additional tests such as blood tests or a biopsy may be necessary to distinguish pityriasis rosea from similar skin disorders.\n', 'Aplasia Cutis Congenita is a rare disorder with a complicated pattern of inheritance. Babies are born with the absence of certain layer(s) of skin, most often on the scalp, but also on the trunk, and/or arms and legs. The affected area is typically covered with a thin, transparent membrane. The skull and/or underlying areas may be visible and be abnormally developed. Aplasia Cutis Congenita may be the primary disorder or it may occur in association with other underlying disorders. Aplasia Cutis Congenita is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  At least five hundred cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Absence of skin is obvious at birth (congenital).\n', 'The exact prevalence of SMARD1 is currently unknown. Studies show that diaphragmatic paralysis affects about 1% percent of individuals diagnosed with early onset spinal muscular atrophy. As of 2015, greater than 60 cases of SMARD1 have been described in scientific literature.\n', 'Mycosis fungoides is a rare form of T-cell lymphoma of the skin (cutaneous); the disease is typically slowly progressive and chronic. In individuals with mycosis fungoides, the skin becomes infiltrated with plaques and nodules that are composed of lymphocytes. In advanced cases, ulcerated tumors and infiltration of lymph nodes by diseased cells may occur. The disorder may spread to other parts of the body including the gastrointestinal system, liver, spleen, or brain. The exact cause of mycosis fungoides is not known. Current theories include antigen persistence, retroviruses (e.g., HTLV-1, etc.), and exposure to cancer-causing (carcinogenic) substances. Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs before age 40 years. It affects males twice as often as females. A diagnosis of mycosis fungoides may be made by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized techniques and tests including DNA cytophotometry, nuclear contour analysis, and analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement.\n', 'Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle (endocardium). This inner lining also covers the heart valves, and it is these valves which are primarily affected by infective endocarditis. If the infection remains untreated, multiplying bacteria may eventually destroy the valves and result in heart failure. Bacteria may also form small clots (emboli) which move through the blood and block small arteries. These clots may lodge in various parts of the body including the brain and cause serious damage.\n', 'Neonatal hemochromatosis is a disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Neonatal hemochromatosis is the most common cause of liver failure in newborns and the most common reason for a liver transplant in newborns. Neonatal hemochromatosis was first reported in the medical literature in 1957.\n', '"Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare congenital (present at birth) heart defect. Normally, the human heart has four chambers of which two are the atria. These two are separated from each other by a partition (septum) called the atrial septum. The other two chambers, known as ventricles, are also separated by a septum. In cor triatriatum there is a small extra chamber above the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins, returning blood from the lungs, drain into this extra ""third atrium."" The passage of blood from the lungs into the heart (left atrium and ventricle) is slowed by this extra chamber. Cor triatriatum may eventually lead to features of congestive heart failure and obstruction over time. The exact cause of cor triatriatum is not known. Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare congenital heart condition that affects males and females in equal numbers.  In the USA, this disorder accounts for an extremely small percentage (0.1% to 0.4%) of all infants with congenital heart disease. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum is usually made by using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (EC). In another procedure known as a cardiac catheterization, a long fine tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and then channeled directly into the heart. This allows the physician to further identify heart defects and to determine the rates of blood flow through the heart. Angiography is also a very useful diagnostic procedure and allows the physician to view an enhanced x-ray of the heart. Children with cor triatriatum also have abnormal EKG patterns."\n', 'Familial LPL deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 250,000 people in the general population and has been described in all races. The prevalence is much higher in Quebec, Canada due to a founder effect. A founder effect is when a small isolated population of settlers (founders) expands over several generations leading to a high prevalence of a particular genetic trait.\n', 'Takayasu arteritis is a rare disorder characterized by the progressive inflammation of one or more of the larger arteries leading from the heart. The main artery of the heart (aorta) and the pulmonary (lung) artery, among others, may be affected. When this disorder causes progressive inflammation of many arteries, it is known as polyarteritis. One of the consequences of polyarteritis is the reduction of blood flow to any of several organs and/or arms and legs. Arteries in the head and arms may be affected, and this can result in the loss of the major pulse points in the body. Some people with Takayasu arteritis have irregular narrowing of portions of the large arteries (segmental stenosis) and abnormal backward flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle of the heart (aortic regurgitation). Other patients may have symptoms of ballooning and weakening (aneurysm) of the wall of a major vessel. Takayasu arteritis is a rare disorder that affects more females than males. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of the cases affect females.  This disorder is common in Japan, and occurs throughout the Orient.  Takayasu arteritis has been reported in India and South America.  The symptoms of this disorder typically begin between 15 and 35 years of age although it can affect children as well.  It is estimated that between 2 and 3 new cases per million are recorded in the USA population per year.\n', 'Cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis is a not uncommon disorder characterized by an inflammation of the blood vessel walls and skin lesions. These skin lesions may be flat and red (macules), nodules or more substantial hemorrhages under the skin (purpura). They may occur on many areas of the body but are seen most often on the back, hands, buttocks, the inside areas of the forearm and the lower extremities. These skin symptoms may occur only once or at regular intervals. They will usually last for several weeks and may leave darkened spots and scarring. In some cases there may be wheel-like lesions that cause intense itching (urticaria), or ring-shaped lesions and ulcers. Blister-like lesions (vesicles, bullae) may develop in severe cases. There may also be fever, generalized discomfort (malaise), muscle or joint pain. Cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis affects males and females in equal numbers. It affects children as well as adults. CNV is more common than the other inflammatory vascular disorders. The results of a skin biopsy demonstrate the presence or absence of CNV. Since a number of the more severe vasculitides involve the skin as well as other organ systems, additional tests of other organs must be prescribed in order to be sure that CNV is limited to the skin.\n', 'Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are inborn errors of creatine metabolism which interrupt the formation or transportation of creatine.  Creatine is necessary to increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to all cells in the body.  Creatine is essential to sustain the high energy levels needed for muscle and brain development. CTD is estimated to account for 1-2% of all unexplained X-linked intellectual disabilities. In regards to GAMT deficiency, there have been estimations from 1 out of 2,640,000 to 1 out of 550,000 patients being diagnosed to a conflicting report of 1 out of 115,000 patients being diagnosed.  As of 2015, there have only been 110 individuals with GAMT deficiency diagnosed worldwide. The prevalence of AGAT is not known because there have been no studies on record. CCDS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays. CCDS screening is non-invasive. Testing in both urine and plasma is recommended for all three types of CCDS by measuring the concentration of creatine (Cr), guanidinoacetate (GAA), and creatinine (Crn).  Follow up genomic testing for specific genes and brain MRI with spectroscopy may be ordered to confirm a CCDS diagnosis.\n', 'Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare disorder of unknown origin that affects many body systems, including as the eyes, ears, skin, and the covering of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges). The most noticeable symptom is a rapid loss of vision. There may also be neurological signs such as severe headache, vertigo, nausea, and drowsiness. Loss of hearing, and loss of hair (alopecia) and skin color may occur along, with whitening (loss of pigmentation) of the hair and eyelashes (poliosis). Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is more prevalent in Oriental, Hispanic, and American Indian populations than in people who trace their ancestry to northern Europe. Onset typically occurs at around 30 or 40 years of age, but cases have been reported among children as young as four years old.\n', 'The incidence and prevalence of Evans syndrome is unknown. The disorder can affect children or adults.\n', 'Kernicterus is a rare neurological disorder characterized by excessive levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) during infancy. Bilirubin is an orange-yellow bile pigment that is a byproduct of the natural breakdown of hemoglobin in red blood cells (hemolysis). Toxic levels of bilirubin may accumulate in the brain, potentially resulting in a variety of symptoms and physical findings. These symptoms may include lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding habits, fever, and vomiting. Affected infants may also experience the absence of certain reflexes (e.g., Moro reflex, etc.); mild to severe muscle spasms including those in which the head and heels are bent backward and the body bows forward (opisthotonus); and/or uncontrolled involuntary muscle movements (spasticity). In some cases, infants with kernicterus may develop life-threatening complications. Kernicterus is a rare neurological disorder that affects newborn infants of both sexes in equal numbers.  Kernicterus occurs more often in premature infants than full-term infants. Kernicterus may be suspected within the first days of life. The diagnosis may be based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic physical findings (e.g., jaundice, abnormal cry, loss of Moro reflex, etc.). In most cases, persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice) is apparent within the first few days of life.\n', '47, XXY (KS) is not inherited. Males with 47, XXY (KS) have one extra X chromosome because of a nondisjunction error that randomly occurs during the division of the sex chromosomes in the egg or sperm. Some males with 47, XXY (KS) are mosaic, meaning that some cells have an extra X chromosome and other cells do not. Mosaic 47, XXY (KS) occurs because of an error in the division of the sex chromosomes in the zygote after fertilization. The extra X chromosome typically results in primary testicular failure leading to androgen deficiency. 47, XXY (KS) is the most common human sex chromosome disorder and occurs in approximately 1 in 500-1,000 males. It is estimated that 3,000 affected boys are born each year in the United States. Kallmann syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that mostly, but not exclusively, affects men. The major characteristics of Kallmann syndrome, in both men and women, are the failure to experience puberty and the complete or partial loss of the sense of smell. Failure to go through puberty reflects a hormonal imbalance that is caused by a failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. Patients with Kallmann syndrome show evidence of small genitalia, sterile gonads that cannot produce the sex cells (hypogonadism), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). The impaired production of hormones as well as sperm and egg cells causes delayed puberty, growth and infertility. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Kallmann syndrome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Males with 47, XXY (KS) are most commonly identified before birth (e.g. through prenatal screenings for chromosomal disorders), at puberty, or later in life because of infertility. 47, XXY (KS) is diagnosed by a chromosome karyotype analysis on a blood sample or by a chromosomal microarray (CMA) test. CMA consists of an oral cheek (buccal) swab and is an easy and painless way to detect abnormalities of chromosome numbers and provide a definitive diagnosis. 47, XXY (KS) can also be diagnosed prenatally on chorionic villous or amniotic fluid cells.\n', 'Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is an extremely rare disease characterized by various intestinal polyps, loss of taste, hair loss, and nail growth problems. It is difficult to treat because of malabsorption that accompanies the polyps. CCS occurs primarily in the older population (average age 59) and predominantly occurs in males. It is considered to be an acquired, not hereditary, disease. The exact cause of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is unknown. It seems to occur for no known reason (sporadically) and is not thought to be hereditary. Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males predominantly. (The ratio seems to be approximately 3 males to 2 females.) Typically, the age of onset is during the middle years or old age. The average is about 59 years with a range of 31 to 86 years. Worldwide, over 500 cases have been reported in the past 50 years, primarily in Japan but also in the United States and other countries.\n', 'Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) is a rare genetic disorder with defects of the head and neck that are apparent at birth (congenital) and usually diagnosed in childhood. As of 2018, fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature, although additional patients are probably followed world-wide. BOFS is a very rare disorder that apparently affects males and females in equal numbers. Fertility does not appear to be affected since there are many affected parents and children. People vary within families and compared to other families.\n', 'Factor X deficiency affects both men and women and can occur in individuals of any ethnic or racial group. The disorder is estimated to affect about 1 in every 500,000-1,000,000 people in the general population. Rare disorders like factor X deficiency often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Bowen Hutterite syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized by growth delays before birth (intrauterine growth retardation); failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) during infancy; malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive appearance; and other physical abnormalities. These may include restricted joint movements, abnormal deviation (clinodactyly) or permanent flexion (camptodactyly) of the fifth fingers, foot deformities, and/or undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in affected males. Some affected infants may also have kidney (renal), brain, and/or other malformations. Bowen Hutterite syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Bowen Hutterite syndrome appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in two brothers in 1976 (P. Bowen), over 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Most affected individuals are Hutterites.  The Hutterites are members of a religious sect (Anabaptists) originally from Moravia who live communally in certain regions of the United States (e.g., Montana, North and South Dakota) and Alberta, Canada.\n', "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by the abnormal development of bone in areas of the body where bone is not normally present (heterotopic ossification), such as the ligaments, tendons, and skeletal muscles. Specifically, this disorder causes the body's skeletal muscles and soft connective tissues to undergo a metamorphosis, essentially a transformation into bone, progressively locking joints in place and making movement difficult or impossible. FOP is characterized by malformed big toes that are present at birth (congenital). Other skeletal malformations of the cervical spine and ribs and the abnormal development of bone at multiple soft tissue sites may lead episodically to stiffness in affected areas, limited movement, and eventual ankylosis of affected joints (neck, shoulders, elbows, hips knees, wrists, ankles, jaw, often in that order).\n", 'Weaver Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males three times more often than females. The syndrome is usually present before birth (prenatal onset). Treatment of Weaver Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. An orthopedist can be consulted for correction of foot deformities. Genetic counseling may be of benefit to patients and their families.\n', 'Cholera is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium vibrio cholerae, which lives and multiples (colonizes) in the small intestine but does not destroy or invade the intestinal tissue (noninvasive). The major symptom of cholera is massive watery diarrhea that occurs because of a toxin secreted by the bacteria that stimulates the cells of the small intestine to secrete fluid. There are several strains of V. cholerae and the severity of the disease is based on the particular infectious strain. Cholera is caused by the bacterium vibrio cholerae which is a rod-shaped gram negative organism.  There are several different types of this bacteria which can produce mild or more severe forms of the disease.  The symptoms of cholera develop due to the release of a toxin (Vibrio c. 01) by the bacteria.\n', 'SHORT syndrome is a rare condition in which affected individuals have multiple birth defects in different organ systems. SHORT syndrome was first described by RJ Gorlin et al in 1975 based on the striking physical features of two infants born to normal parents. Over time, more affected individuals have been described and the clinical definition of SHORT syndrome has been expanded. Each letter of SHORT syndrome represents one of the common findings in affected persons: SHORT syndrome is a very rare disorder with fewer than 50 reported cases in the literature to date. SHORT syndrome is not known to be more prevalent in a certain ethnic group or geographic location.\n', 'Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is a rare acquired disorder characterized by acute and severe recurrent attacks associated with a rapid fall in blood pressure. Attacks often last several days and require emergency care. They are sometimes fatal. SCLS occurs most often in adults and the disease is very rare in children. SCLS is not hereditary. More than one half of patients have a monoclonal or M protein detected in the blood. The level of M protein is usually low.  The M protein is produced by what usually amount to small numbers of plasma cells in the marrow.   The M protein itself does not appear to cause the attacks. Many possible explanations have been offered including an autoimmune mechanism. Recently it has been suggested that capillary lining cells may be damaged by a factor in the blood, which is produced during the acute attack.  SCLS has been recognized in a range of racial backgrounds and nationalities. Although the cause of SCLS is not yet known, there appears to be no genetic predisposition to the disease. There are less than 100 patients reported in the world literature since its first description in 1960 by Clarkson. SCLS seems to occur more often in males and older adults. The disease may be more frequent than the literature suggests because the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. SCLS may be mistaken for a severe infection such as septic shock or toxic shock syndrome.  Some features such as the swelling may lead one to suspect heart failure or kidney disease. C-1 esterase inhibitor deficiency syndrome may present with a type of recurring edema called angioedema and is often thought of in patients presenting with SCLS. In some cases the hemoconcentration and resulting high hematocrit and hemoglobin level have been mistaken for polycythemia.\n', 'FFI is an extremely rare disorder. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. The sporadic form of FFI, known as sporadic fatal insomnia (SFI), is extremely rare and has only been described in the medical literature in about two dozen people. Collectively, prion disorders affect about 1 in 1,000,000 million people in the general population per year. Genetic prion diseases are believed to make up about 15% of all individuals with prion diseases. Because rare diseases often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. FFI affects men and women in equal numbers. The average age of onset is 45-50 years old, although the disorder has been described occurring in individuals in their teens and as late as their 70s. FFI has been described in populations around the world.\n', 'All types of SCID are very rare disorders that occur in approximately 1 or fewer births in 100,000 in the United States. SCID may be more common in people with Navajo, Apache, or Turkish ancestry. SCID is now diagnosed mainly through from newborn screening in most states.\xa0 The screen is performed using the dried blood spot from newborn screening (or Guthrie) cards measuring levels T-cell receptor excision circles (or TREC).\xa0 Although each state has a slightly different methods and thresholds, a low TREC test means the infant has low numbers of lymphocytes in the blood at the time of the test.\xa0 The result must then be confirmed with additional testing. A complete blood count (CBC) coupled with lymphocyte subset testing may show low levels of B, T, and/or NK cells. Additional tests can show that one or more of these cell types aren’t functioning properly. Genetic and biochemical (protein expression) tests are available for some forms of SCID. A combination of these tests may be required to make an accurate diagnosis needed to plan treatment.\n', 'General Discussion Eisenmenger syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. Individuals with Down syndrome represent between 25-50% of the adult Eisenmenger population. The diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome is not particularly complex but may require cardiac catheterization, an invasive procedure to measure pressures in the heart and lungs. Other tests include pulse oximetry, which checks oxygen levels in the blood, chest x-ray, EKG, pulmonary function test, iron levels and complete blood count (CBC). Echocardiography is fundamental in identifying the heart defect and raising the suspicion of high pressures in the lungs. Other imaging modalities (e.g. cardiac MRI) can provide valuable anatomic information.\n', '"Canavan disease is rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by the spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain. Affected infants may appear normal at birth, but usually develop symptoms between 3-6 months of age. Symptoms may include an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), lack of head control, severely diminished muscle tone resulting in ""floppiness,"" and delays in reaching developmental milestones such as independent sitting and walking. Most affected children develop life-threatening complications by 10 years of age. Canavan disease occurs because of mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene that affects the breakdown (metabolism) of the N-acetylaspartic acid (NNA). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Canavan disease affects males and females in equal numbers. It affects all ethnic groups, but occurs with greater frequency in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. In this population, the carrier frequency is estimated to be as high as one in 40-58 people. The risk for an affected child born to Ashkenazi Jewish parents is between 1 and 6,400 and 1 in 13,456. The carrier frequency in other populations is not known, but most likely far lower. The overall incidence of Canavan disease in the general population is unknown."\n', 'Primary myelofibrosis is a chronic blood disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. It can occur at any age although it usually affects individuals more than 50 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 65. The incidence is estimated to be 1.5 cases per 100,000 people in the United States. In studies of Northern European countries, the incidence was estimated to be .5 cases per 100,000 people. The worldwide incidence is unknown. When primary myelofibrosis affects children, it is usually before three years of age. In younger children, girls are affected twice as often as boys. Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and various specialized tests. In many people, the presenting sign of the disorder is an abnormally enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) that may be detected upon routine examination or low levels of circulating red blood cells. A complete blood count (CBC) may demonstrate low levels of red blood cells or elevated levels of platelets or white blood cells. Since blood cell counts vary at different times in affected individuals, blood counts are not definitive in diagnosing primary myelofibrosis. Surgical removal and microscopic examination of bone marrow tissue (biopsy) is often used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis.\n', 'Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy is almost nonexistent in the United States, but in Japan is second only to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in frequency. The incidence in Japan is reported as about 0.7-1.2 cases per 100,000 children. The diagnosis depends on a thorough physical examination and medical history. In addition, the physician will look for information to assist in the diagnosis from several tests such as blood tests to detect abnormally high levels of a particular enzyme (creatine kinase) released form the cells of damaged muscles, and blood fukutin gene mutations, electromyographic studies to determine the area of muscle that is damaged, and muscle biopsy to distinguish muscular dystrophy from other neuromuscular disorders.\n', 'Onset of NEC is typically during the first several weeks after birth when feeds have been started, and the age of onset inversely related to gestational age at birth. Early in the disease process, neonates can exhibit signs of feeding intolerance with vomiting, increased gastric aspirates, bile-tinged (green) gastric aspirates, or decreased bowel sounds with abdominal distention and tenderness. Gross or occult blood can be present in stools indicating mucosal injury. Many of these signs are non-specific and can occur with other disorders. Progression of NEC results in systemic signs such as lethargy, long pauses in breathing called apnea, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (pumping of fluid through an organ or tissue.) Ultimately this can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. A palpable mass and erythema (abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion, as in inflammation) of the abdominal wall is indicative of a more advanced disease process. NEC affects 5 to 10% of premature infants born weighing less than 1500 g. Among the risk factors defined for NEC, prematurity and birth weight remain inversely related to risk for NEC. Term infants who develop NEC usually have specific risk factors such as congenital heart disease, sepsis, and low blood pressure. Many other gastrointestinal diseases can mimic NEC, so when evaluating a patient it is important to consider and treat alternative etiologies. Sepsis can cause an ileus with abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. Premature infants, especially those on indomethacin or steroids can also present with spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). SIP is characterized by isolated perforation of the distal small bowel. Other causes of severe abdominal distention in neonates include bowel obstruction from Hirshsprung’s disease, small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, and malrotation with volvulus. NEC can also be mistaken for allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow’s milk protein allergy. NEC is diagnosed clinically and radiographically. Once clinical suspicion arises, an abdominal X-ray is performed as an initial evaluation. This is repeated serially depending on acuity and clinical course to assess disease progression. Characteristic findings on NEC process on abdominal radiographs include pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), abnormal persistent dilated loops, thickened bowel wall, pneumoperitoneum and portal vein gas. Pneumoperitoneum defined as abdominal free air is a surgical emergency indicating bowel perforation and usually requires intervention. Abdominal ultrasonography can also be used to evaluate for free fluid in the abdominal cavity or abscess formation. Addition laboratory studies to evaluate severity of NEC include a blood culture, coagulation studies and complete blood count with manual differential to assess for leukocytosis with bandemia, neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Blood gases are checked serially to assess severity of acidosis and need for respiratory support or to assist with fluid management.\n', 'Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild intellectual disability in affected females. Distinctive physical features are sometimes present in affected males including a large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears, loose joints and large testes, but these features develop over time and may not be obvious until puberty. Motor and language delays are usually present but also become more apparent over time. Behavioral abnormalities including autistic behaviors are common. Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild intellectual disability in affected females. The physical features in affected males are variable and may not be obvious until puberty. These symptoms can include a large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears, loose joints and large testes. Other symptoms can include flat feet, frequent ear infections, low muscle tone, a long narrow face, high arched palate, dental problems, crossed eyes (strabismus) and heart problems including mitral valve prolapse. Delayed motor development, hyperactivity, behavior problems, toe walking, and/or occasional seizures can also occur in some patients. Autistic behaviors such as poor eye contact, hand flapping, and/or self-stimulating behaviors are also common. Motor and language delays are usually present but become more apparent over time. The fragile X syndrome affects about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 females in the USA; that is, it affects about twice as many males as it does females. However, about four times as many females appear to be carriers of the altered gene as do males (1:250 females and 1:1000 males). Fragile X syndrome has been found in all major ethnic groups and races.\n', 'Familial dysautonomia is a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. This disorder primarily affects infants of Ashkenazi Jewish or Eastern European ancestry; approximately 1 in 30 people of East European Jewish ancestry are thought to be carriers of the defective gene that causes this disorder.\n', 'Homocystinuria is a rare metabolic condition characterized by an excess of the compound homocystine in the urine. The condition may result from deficiency of any of several enzymes involved in the conversion of the essential amino acid methionine to another amino acid (cysteine)--or, less commonly, impaired conversion of the compound homocysteine to methionine. Enzymes are proteins that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions in the body. Certain amino acids, which are the chemical building blocks of proteins, are essential for proper growth and development. In most cases, homocystinuria is caused by reduced activity of an enzyme known as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Infants who develop homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency (which is also known as classical homocystinuria) may fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and have developmental delays.\n', 'FXN  The prevalence of FRDA is approximately 1 in 40,000 people. FRDA is the most common inherited ataxia in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia (Indian subcontinent), and North Africa. It is rarely identified in other populations.\n', 'TSC1 Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 6,000 newborns in the United States. Approximately 40,000 to 80,000 people in the United States have tuberous sclerosis. The prevalence in Europe is estimated to be approximately 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 11,300. As many as 2 million people worldwide are believed to have the disorder. Males and females are affected in equal numbers and the disorder occurs in all races and ethnic groups.\n', 'Winchester syndrome is an extremely rare connective tissue disorder believed by some scientists to be closely related to the mucopolysaccharidoses, which is a group of hereditary metabolic diseases caused by the absence or malfunction of certain enzymes, leading to the accumulation in cells and tissues of molecules that would normally be broken down into smaller units. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, arthritis-like symptoms, nodules under the skin (subcutaneous), coarse facial features, and eye and teeth abnormalities. Winchester syndrome is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Since the original description of this syndrome in 1969, only about a dozen cases have been described in the medical literature.  Those identified with the syndrome to date have included individuals of Mexican, Indian, Puerto Rican and Iranian descent.  Additional affected individuals may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Diagnostic criteria for Winchester syndrome were developed to include characteristic skeletal radiologic findings plus at least two of the following signs: short stature, progressive fusion (contractures) of the joints, cataracts, coarse facial features, darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation), and the growth of hair in the leathery patches of skin.\n', "Tropical Sprue is a rare digestive disease in which the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients is impaired (malabsorption). Consequently, nutritional deficiencies and abnormalities in the mucous lining of the small intestine may be present. The exact cause of this disorder is not known, however it may be related to environmental and nutritional conditions in the tropical regions where it is most prevalent. The exact cause of Tropical Sprue is not known.  It is an acquired disorder that may be related to environmental and nutritional factors, or Tropical Sprue may be related to an infectious organism (either viral or bacterial), dietary toxin, parasitic infestation, or a nutritional deficiency such as folic acid.  Tropical Sprue causes damage to the mucosal lining of the intestine resulting the impaired absorption of food, minerals, and water. Tropical Sprue is a rare disorder in temperate regions.  It occurs mainly in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, India, South Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Transients, tourists and visitors to these areas can be affected. Treatment for Tropical Sprue includes the use of folic acid, cobalamin, and antibiotics such as tetracycline, oxytetracycline, or ampicillin. The dosage of these medications depends on the severity of the disorder as well as how the patient responds to the therapy. Combined therapy with folic acid and tetracycline seems to rapidly reduce the severity of the symptoms and also heal unhealthy tissue in the small intestine. Other nutrients may be given as needed (i.e., iron, vitamin B12). Diarrhea associated with this disorder may be controlled with anti-diarrhea agents.\n", 'Imperforate anus is a rare inborn abnormality characterized by the absence or abnormal localization of the anus. The rectum or the colon may be connected to the vagina or the bladder by a tunnel (fistula). With surgical correction, normal elimination can become possible. Imperforate anus is an abnormality present at birth, and characterized by the absence of the normal opening of the anus.  Elimination of feces may not be possible until surgery is performed.  In some cases the rectum opens into the lower part of the vagina in females, or close to the scrotum in males. Imperforate anus and other related abnormalities of the anus and rectum (anorectal malformations) occur in approximately one in 4,000 to 5,000 newborns in the United States.  Reported instances of imperforate anus include affected individuals in whom the condition appeared to occur sporadically, members of certain multigenerational families (kindreds), and individuals in whom the condition occurred in association with other birth defects or malformation syndromes (e.g., VACTERL association). Imperforate anus is surgically corrected by dilating, enlarging or repositioning the external opening, or other ways of providing an adequate rectal opening. Genetic counseling may be of benefit to patients and their families.\n', 'Polycythemia vera affects slightly more men than women. The disorder is estimated to affect approximately 2 people per 100,000 in the general population. It occurs most often in individuals more than 60 years old, but can affect individuals of any age. It is extremely rare in individuals under 20.\n', 'Mucolipidosis IV is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by intellectual disability; severe impairment in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of muscular and mental activities (psychomotor retardation); diminished muscle tone (hypotonia); clouding (opacity) of the clear portion of the eyes through which light passes (cornea); and progressive degeneration of the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (retinal degeneration). Mucolipidosis IV is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait and caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene. Mucolipidosis IV is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder was first identified in 1974 and as of 2010, 70 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  The precise incidence is unknown, but is estimated to be approximately 1:40,000. About 70% of those diagnosed are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Mucolipidosis IV may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical examination, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Individuals with mucolipidosis IV present with iron deficiency anemia, high serum gastrin levels and characteristic findings on brain MRI examinations. In most cases, an electron microscope is used to visualize characteristic lysosomal storage bodies in fibroblasts obtained from biopsied tissue of the skin and/or the delicate membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctiva). Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the MCOLN1 gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.\n', 'Maxillofacial dysostosis is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial) area. Major symptoms include an underdeveloped (hypoplasia) upper jaw, downward-slanting palpebral fissures (which means that the opening between the eyelids slants downward), minor malformations of the external portion of the ears, and speech abnormalities. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A second (distinct) form of maxillofacial dysostosis is believed to be inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic diseases are determined by the combination of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes received from the father and the mother. Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. Maxillofacial dysostosis is extremely rare and the exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Approximately 12 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers believe that cases of maxillofacial dysostosis may go misdiagnosed or unrecognized making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population. Maxillofacial dysostosis most likely affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of maxillofacial dysostosis is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests to rule out other disorders.\n', 'Q fever is an infectious disease that is spread by the inhalation or ingestion of a bacterium known as Coxiella burnetii, which belongs to the order of Legionellales. C. burnetii is spread mainly by breathing contaminated air or eating or drinking a contaminated food. Farm workers, especially those who work with animals, people who work in slaughterhouses and veterinarians are especially vulnerable to this disease. Because infection can occur as a result of airborne transmission and the agent is very resistant to environmental conditions, it was included on the list of possible bacteriological weapons. Q fever causes highly variable diseases ranging from acute (often self-limited) infection to fatal chronic infection. Infections that do not cause outward symptoms (subclinical) or no symptoms (asymptomatic) are also common.\n', 'The diagnosis of meningioma is mostly based on a patient history and physical examination, medical imaging, and analysis of the cells composing the tumor. A patient that has signs and symptoms suggestive of a central nervous system lesion such as recent onset of seizures or neurological deficits (for more details, see the “Signs & Symptoms” section) will usually undergo brain and/or spine medical imaging with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation of brain tumors. Although the presence of a meningioma can be suspected with medical imaging due to their characteristic location, analysis of the cells of the tumor provides the most definitive diagnosis. Meningioma cells can be obtained by removing a piece of the tumor with a biopsy. However, meningiomas are usually removed surgically without a prior biopsy as this provides therapeutic in addition to diagnostic benefit. Once tumor cells are obtained, they can be observed under the microscope by a pathologist, who will confirm the diagnosis. A laboratory technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to stain meningioma cells to facilitate their identification.\n', 'Cri du chat syndrome affects females more often than males. The incidence ranges from 1-15,000 to 50,000 live births. Some cases of cri du chat syndrome may go undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population.\n', 'Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a group of conditions involving the central nervous system and representing more than a dozen different diseases. These diseases share certain features, including a worsening of symptoms over time and the presence of both muscle contractions (myoclonus) and seizures (epilepsy). Patients may have more than one type of seizure, such as petit mal or grand mal. PME is progressive, but the rate of progression may be quick or slow, depending on the underlying disease. Progressive myoclonus epilepsy is diagnosed by clinical findings and Electroencephalogram (EEG) results.  Molecular genetic testing is available for genes associated with EPM1, EPM2A, and for some of the genes associated with other types of PME.\n', 'Brown Syndrome is a rare eye disorder characterized by defects in eye movements. This disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or may occur as the result of another underlying disorder (acquired). Muscles control the movements of the eyes. Some of these muscles turn the eyeball up and down, move the eyeball from side to side, or enable the eyeball to rotate slightly in its socket. The superior oblique tendon sheath of the superior oblique muscle surrounds the eyeball. The symptoms of Brown Syndrome are caused by abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. This results in the inability to move the affected eye upward. People with Brown Syndrome have limited eye movement in the affected eye. The ability to move the eyeball toward the center (adduction), or outward from the center (abduction), may be restricted or absent.  One eye may appear to be out of alignment with the unaffected eye, especially when looking upward.  The symptoms of Brown Syndrome may also include a droopy eyelid (ptosis), widening of the eye (palpebral fissure) when looking upward, crossing of the eyes (strabismus), and/or a backward head tilt.  A downward appearance (hypotropia) is usually present in the affected eye when the individual is looking straight ahead (primary position) or in an upward direction.  One eye is usually affected, but both eyes (bilateral) may be affected in approximately 10 percent of people with Brown Syndrome. Brown Syndrome is a rare eye disorder that affects slightly more females than males.  The symptoms of the congenital form of the disease are usually present at birth.  The acquired form may occur at any age.\n', 'General Discussion Holt-Oram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that occurs in many racial and ethnic groups; and affects males and females in equal numbers. The estimated prevalence is 1/100,000 livebirths.\n', 'ADNP syndrome affects females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. According to one estimate, about 1 in 20,000 people in the general population in the United States and Europe have the disorder. Rare disorders like ADNP syndrome often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. ADNP syndrome is believed to account for about .17% of individuals with autism, making it one of the most common, single-gene causes of an autism spectrum disorder. Approximately 205 affected children have been identified worldwide in the medical literature and as reported by the ADNP Kids Research Foundation as of January 2019.\n', "Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a syndrome that affects some people who have had polio (poliomyelitis) and occurs many years (typically from 10 to 40 years) after recovery from the initial infection. It is characterized by the development of progressive weakness in muscles that were affected by the original polio infection. In addition, those affected may experience extreme fatigue and joint pain. Skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, may occur as a result of this syndrome. There is variation in the severity of symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms may mimic those of the rare disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The degree of muscle atrophy during the post-polio period appears to reflect the severity of the impact of the initial polio infection. People who were significantly affected by polio are more likely to experience severe symptoms from post-polio syndrome. The cause of this syndrome is not known. Although exact numbers are not available, it has been estimated that there are 300,000 polio survivors in the United States and that from one-fourth to one-half of them may ultimately develop some degree of post-polio syndrome. Post-polio syndrome affects people who have had acute episodes of poliomyelitis.  It occurs 10 years or more after the original illness, and can occur as long as 40 years afterward.  According to one estimate, 25% to 50% of the 300,000 polio survivors in the United States may develop the syndrome.  At the present time, there is no known way to prevent the syndrome. Diagnosis of post-polio syndrome is made on the basis of a thorough history, a neurological examination, and the process of excluding other possible diseases through various tests. In making the diagnosis, physicians will be aware of three factors. a prior diagnosis of polio, an interval of one or more decades since the original acute episode, and slow, steady, progressive deterioration.\n", 'In earlier reports, hypomelanosis of Ito affected women more often than men by a ratio of 2.5:1. More recent, larger studies suggest that the difference may not be as large. The incidence of hypomelanosis of Ito is estimated to be 1 in 8,000-10,000 people in the general population. The symptoms usually become apparent during the first or second year of life. Hypomelanosis of Ito was first described in the medical literature in 1952.\n', 'Gastroparesis (abbreviated as GP) represents a clinical syndrome characterized by sluggish emptying of solid food (and more rarely, liquid nutrients) from the stomach, which causes persistent digestive symptoms especially nausea and primarily affects young to middle-aged women, but is also known to affect younger children and males. Diagnosis is made based upon a radiographic gastric emptying test. Diabetics and those acquiring gastroparesis for unknown (or, idiopathic) causes represent the two largest groups of gastroparetic patients; however, numerous etiologies (both rare and common) can lead to a gastroparesis syndrome. Gastroparesis demonstrates a gender bias affecting more women than men. Approximately 80% of idiopathic cases are women. Idiopathic gastroparesis may be linked to an as yet-to-be-elucidated enteric autoimmune disease. The prevalence of delayed gastric emptying in Type 1 diabetics has been reported to be 50% and in type 2 diabetics, reports range from 30% to 50%. Post surgical gastroparesis is a recognized as inadvertent vagal nerve damage or entrapment following upper abdominal surgery, examples are: fundoplication for the treatment of GERD, bariatric surgery, peptic ulcer surgery, anterior approach for spinal surgery (scoliosis), heart, lung transplant, or pancreatic surgery. A stomach motor disturbance known as “dumping syndrome” whereby food or liquids empty too quickly from the stomach can present with similar symptoms as are found in gastroparesis. Other disorders that may clinically present as gastroparesis (gastritis, gastric ulcers, pyloric stenosis, celiac disease, and GI obstructions) need to be ruled out.\n', 'Fryns syndrome is a rare disease that affects both males and females equally. A 1989 French study reported 7 cases per 100,000 live births, but no other recent estimates of prevalence have been published.\n', 'Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) comprises a large group of inherited vision disorders that cause progressive degeneration of the retina, the light sensitive membrane that coats the inside of the eyes. Peripheral (or side) vision gradually decreases and eventually is lost in most cases. Central vision is usually preserved until late in these conditions. Some forms of RP can be associated with deafness, obesity, kidney disease, and various other general health problems, including central nervous system and metabolic disorders, and occasionally chromosomal abnormalities. RP as a group of vision disorders affects about 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 people in the world. This means that, with a population of about 324 million in the United States in mid-July 2017 (see < http://www.census.gov/> for continuous updates), about 81,000 to 108,000 people in the United States have RP or a related disorder. With a worldwide population presently estimated at over 7.05 billion, it can be estimated that approximately 1.77 to 2.35 million people around the world have one of these disorders. Excluding age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, the genetic causes of which are complex and linked simultaneously to more than one gene (so called “polygenic” disorders), RP is the most common cause of inherited visual loss. RP is diagnosed by electroretinography (ERG) showing progressive loss in photoreceptor function, visual field testing, and retinal imaging [mainly by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF) that show detailed microanatomical features that cannot be resolved by naked eye]. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in many of the genes associated with RP is available to confirm the diagnosis.\n', '"Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p is a very rare chromosomal disorder in which the short arm of the ninth chromosome (9p) appears four times (tetrasomy) rather than twice in all or some cells of the body. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up (karyotype) have two 9th chromosomes, both of which have a short arm (""9p"") and a long arm (""9q""). However, in individuals with Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p, four short arms (9ps) are present in cells rather than the normal two. Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p is a very rare chromosomal disorder that appears  to affect males slightly more often than females.  Approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature."\n', "Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a rare form of dwarfism. It is an inherited disorder whose diagnosis depends on the presence of three signs (1) growth retardation, i.e. short stature, (2) abnormal sensitivity to light (photosensitivity), and (3) prematurely aged appearance (progeria). In the classical form of Cockayne Syndrome (CS type I) the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent after the age of one year. An early onset or congenital form of Cockayne Syndrome (CS type II) is apparent at birth (congenital). There is a third form, known as Cockayne Syndrome Type III (CS type III), that presents later in the child's development and is generally a milder form of the disease. A fourth form; now recognized as Xeroderma pigmentosa-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), combines features of both of these disorders. Cockayne Syndrome is very rare and affects males and females in equal numbers. There are no indications of ethnic or racial partiality.   The incidence of CS is less than 1 case per 250,000 live births in the U.S.   As of 1992, about 140 cases of CS had been reported in the literature.\n", 'ARPKD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of ARPKD is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals in the general population. Because some people may go undiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of ARPKD is the general population. Although most patients are diagnosed in utero or at birth, mild cases may not become apparent until adolescence or adulthood. ARPKD can affect individuals of any ethnic group.\n', 'Landau-Kleffner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects twice as many males as females. Affected siblings and discordant monozygotic twins have been reported rarely. In additional to language regression, the diagnosis requires the presence of severely epileptiform activity on EEG, particularly during non-REM sleep. Additional testing may include magnetoencephalography. Brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to exclude structural lesions since several cases have resulted from brain tumors. Other testing including behavioral and/or brainstem evoked audiometry and standardized psychometric and speech/language testing are helpful to exclude hearing loss and provide the basis for therapies to aide in recovery.\n', 'The juvenile form of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The adult form affects males slightly more often than females. In the United States, the incidence of RRP was previously estimated to be approximately 2 per 100,000 adults and 4 per 100,000 children with approximately 1,000 new pediatric cases in the United States each year. With the increased uptake of the HPV vaccine, these numbers are dropping precipitously.  In children, JORRP is most often diagnosed between the ages of 2-4. In adults, the disorder occurs most often in the third or fourth decade though a second peak around age 60 has recently been noted. A variety of conditions can produce signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in RRP. Such conditions include asthma, allergies, chronic bronchitis, croup, vocal nodules, and gastroesophageal reflux. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis.\n', 'Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disorder of the digestive system in which large numbers of a particular type of white blood cell called eosinophils are present in the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Eosinophils are an important part of the immune system and play a role in immune regulation and fighting certain infection, and their accumulation is a hallmark of allergic diseases. This condition is characterized by vomiting, stomach or chest pain, failure to thrive (particularly in children), difficulty swallowing, and food getting stuck in the throat. The symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis are variable, especially in people of different ages. Common symptoms include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); food getting stuck in the throat (impaction); nausea; vomiting; poor growth; weight loss; stomach pain; poor appetite; and malnutrition. Because of an overlap of these symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), many patients are initially thought to have GERD, but EoE patients do not typically respond to anti-GERD therapy and can be found not to have GERD upon diagnostic workup. Recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, typically used for the treatment of GERD, but these patients with PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) do not typically have GERD but rather a disease variant similar to EoE; the PPI appears to exert its effects by direct action rather than blockade of stomach acid alone. Individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis often have allergic diseases such as asthma or eczema. The frequency of eosinophilic esophagitis has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 1,000 children. This condition has been reported in multiple continents including Europe, Australia, and America.\n', 'Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of red, scaly thickened patches of skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis), frequent pus-producing (pyogenic) skin infections, overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the fingernails and toenails (onychogryposis), and degeneration of the structures that surround and support the teeth (periodontosis). Periodontosis usually results in the premature loss of teeth. Additional features associated with the disorder may include flat feet (pes planus); abnormally long, slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly); loss of bone tissue at the ends of the fingers and/or toes (acroosteolysis); and/or other physical findings. Haim-Munk syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is named after the investigators (Haim S, Munk J) who originally reported the disease entity in 1965 among members of an extended Jewish family (kindred) from Cochin, India. Since then, the disorder has been described in over 50 individuals in several multigenerational Jewish families in Cochin. It has sometimes been referred to as Cochin Jewish disorder.\n', 'Sjögren-Larsson syndrome affected both males and females equally and its onset is from birth. The incidence of this condition worldwide is unknown. However, the prevalence in Sweden is 1 in every 250,000 individuals.\n', 'Myhre syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 60 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Because some cases of Myhre syndrome most likely go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of the disorder in the general population is difficult.\n', 'MDR3 deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of MDR3 deficiency is unknown. Concerning PFIC3, fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Because milder forms of MDR3 deficiency often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Giant hypertrophic gastritis (GHG) is a general term for inflammation of the stomach due to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the inner wall (mucosa) of the stomach resulting in abnormally large, coiled ridges or folds that resemble polyps in the inner wall of the stomach (hypertrophic gastric folds). GHG encompasses a collection of disorders. The symptoms of GHG may vary from case to case. The exact cause of GHG is unknown. Giant hypertrophic gastritis affects males and females in equal numbers. It can affect children or adults but occurs with greater frequency in late adulthood.\n', 'Lichen planus (LP) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory autoimmune skin and mucous membrane disease. LP most commonly presents as itchy, shiny, reddish-purple spots (lesions) on the skin (cutaneous LP) or as white-gray lesions in the mouth or on the lips (oral LP). Less commonly, LP may also involve the genitals (penile or vulvar LP), scalp (lichen planopilaris), ears (otic LP), nails, eyes, and esophagus. Similar to lichen found growing on trees and rocks in forests, the skin lesions are often flat-topped and can be somewhat scaly, hence the name “lichen” planus. In most affected individuals, the exact cause of LP is unclear. It is suspected that exposure to infections, drugs, allergens, or injury may sensitize the immune system and cause the immune system to attack skin cells. This initial eruption may persist for weeks to months, and recurrences can continue throughout the individual’s lifetime. There have been reports of LP in family members, indicating that there may be a genetic predisposition, but the genetic factors of LP are still being researched and are uncertain. There is limited data on how many people are affected by LP, but most studies estimate that LP occurs in less than 1 percent of the world’s population. Cutaneous LP occurs at similar frequencies in men and women, but women are somewhat more likely to develop oral LP or lichen planopilaris. There does not appear to be a racial predisposition for the disease. The majority of LP develops between 30 and 60 years of age but can affect older and younger individuals as well. In rare cases, children may be affected.\n', "Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that affects humans and animals. It results in a wide range of symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. It is caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete). Symptoms include high fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). Diagnosis may be made during the early stage of the infection (days 1-7) by culturing the Leptospira bacterium from body fluids. From days 4 through 10, the cerebrospinal fluid is cultured, and after day 10, the patient's urine may be cultured. There are other tests of the blood and immune system that may be performed.\n", 'Hajdu-Cheney syndrome is an extremely rare disorder. More than 80 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature. The exact prevalence or incidence of the disorder is unknown. Rare disorders often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.\n', 'LAM is a rare disorder that predominantly affects women of childbearing age. The average age of affected individuals at symptom onset is 33. More than 400 cases have been reported in the United States in the medical literature since Dr. Von Stossel first described the disorder in 1937. Some estimates suggest that more than 1,000 women in the United States may have LAM. Many researchers believe that the disorder in under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. The Tuberous Sclerosis Association recommends that women with tuberous sclerosis should be screened for LAM at least once on reaching maturity.\n', 'CCHS is a rare disorder that affects females and males in equal numbers. Though the mutation is already present before birth, in milder cases the diagnosis may be missed until after the newborn period. Some affected individuals will not be identified until after receiving sedation, anesthesia, or anti-seizure medications, making it especially important to educate health care personnel about CCHS and to have a high index of suspicion for considering a diagnosis of CCHS. As of 2013, more than 1,000 cases are known worldwide. The birth prevalence of CCHS has been extrapolated from incidence figures and general birth rates, but the true prevalence is unknown as culturally diverse large population based studies have not been reported. Because the milder cases of CCHS may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to estimate the true frequency of CCHS in the general population, though the anticipation is far greater than the current estimate.\n', 'Schinzel Giedion syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The birth prevalence is unknown.  There have been 50 cases reported worldwide.\n', 'SLC26A2 Recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown, but multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, collectively, has been estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 20,000 people in the general population. rMED is estimated to account for approximately 25% of all cases of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Because some cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency these disorders in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Meckel syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The incidence of Meckel syndrome is estimated in various areas around the world to be 1 in 13,250 to 1 in 140,000 live births. The disorder is more common in the Finnish population due to a founder effect, with an incidence of 1 in 9000 and 1 in 3,000 people of Belgian ancestry. However, Gujarati Indians have a prevalence of 1 in 1,300. It often occurs in the context of consanguineous unions. A diagnosis of Meckel syndrome is often made on ultrasound during pregnancy or at birth thorough clinical evaluation. Molecular genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis and guide genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is available through ultrasonography as early as 14 weeks, which can detect certain abnormalities (e.g., encephalocele, polydactyly, cystic kidneys and oligohydramnios). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in conjunction with ultrasonography. Chromosomal analysis may be performed to rule out trisomy 13. Smith Lemli- Opitz syndrome may be excluded by biochemical testing.\n', 'Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder, described in 1964, characterized by excessive growth before and after birth, a large, elongated (dolichocephalic) head, distinctive facial configuration, and a non-progressive neurological disorder with intellectual disability. Advanced bone age is present in approximately 75 to 85% of patients. Sotos syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers, occurs in all ethnic groups and has been detected throughout the world. This condition occurs in about one in 14,000 live births.\n', 'Short bowel syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is usually acquired during life, but in rare cases may be present at birth (congenital). In adults, short bowel syndrome usually results from the surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine. Crohn’s disease is the most frequent cause of surgical removal of the small intestine in adults. In newborns, necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause of surgical removal of the small intestines. The exact incidence and prevalence of short bowel syndrome in the general population is unknown.\n', 'Malignant Melanoma is a common skin cancer that arises from the melanin cells within the upper layer of the skin (epidermis) or from similar cells that may be found in moles (nevi). This type of skin cancer may send down roots into deeper layers of the skin. Some of these microscopic roots may spread (metastasize) causing new tumor growths in vital organs of the body.\n', 'Although pars planitis is generally benign, there can be significant vision loss in extreme cases. It is an immunological disorder of the eye characterized by inflammation of a part of the uvea, the layer of tissue between the sclera and the retina, the membranes protecting the eyeball. The uvea, in turn, is made up of three portions: the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid. In addition, the uvea contains many of the blood vessels that supply the eye. Pars planitis is an uncommon ocular disorder of children and young adults that affects males slightly more frequently than females. Pars planitis is usually diagnosed by means of a thorough physical evaluation, detailed patient history, and specialized eye examination.\n', 'It has become easier to distinguish SCD from other disorders as for all children born in the US get tested for SCD at birth. In older patients and immigrants, SCD should be considered in those with anemia and / or recurrent pain, especially if they have family from the regions sickle cell is most common (for example Africa, and regions listed above). The diagnosis is easily confirmed with simple blood tests.\n', 'Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of disease ranging from a mild movement disorder at one end to a life-threatening, neurological disorder at the other. The symptoms of the disorder can vary widely from person to another, even among members of the same family. Common symptoms include an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking (abnormal gait) and dystonia. Dystonia is a general term for a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Dystonia in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency usually affects the legs. Additional symptoms that may occur include tremors, eye abnormalities, and a tendency of affected children to walk on their tiptoes. The severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency causes symptoms at a very young age (first months of life). The symptoms generally do not resemble those of a movement disorder, but rather give the impression of a severe, diffuse brain disorder. Mild and moderate forms of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency show dramatic improvement when treated with levodopa. Levodopa is an amino acid that is converted to dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that serves as a neurotransmitter and is deficient in children with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment options for severe tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency have been less effective. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency occurs due to disruptions or changes (mutations) of the TH gene. The TH gene mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The exact incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency in the general population is unknown. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers believe that the disorder is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I deficiency (autosomal dominant Segawa syndrome) account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of primary dystonia in childhood. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency was first described in the medical literature in the 1970s.\n', 'Brucellosis is an infectious disease that affects livestock and may be transmitted to humans. It is rare in the United States, but occurs more frequently in other parts of the world. The disorder is caused by one of four different species of bacteria that belong to the genus Brucella. Initial symptoms of infection may be nonspecific including fevers, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, profuse sweating, and physical weakness. In some cases, the symptoms occur suddenly (acute), whereas, in others, symptoms may develop over the course of a few months. If brucellosis is not treated, the disease may take months to resolve once appropriate therapy is begun.\n', 'Balantidiasis is a rare intestinal infection caused by the bacterium, Balantidium coli, a single celled parasite (ciliate protozoan) that frequently infects pigs but on occasion (rarely) infects humans. Some infected people may have no symptoms or only mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort but others may experience more severe symptoms reminiscent of an acute inflammation of the intestines. Symptoms of Balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. Most people with Balantidiasis are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms.  Some individuals may become acutely ill with abnormally high temperatures, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.  Such conditions may result in the excessive loss of water from the body (dehydration) and extreme exhaustion (prostration), especially if B. coli attacks the intestinal lining causing inflammation and possibly “crater-like” areas of damage (ulceration).  In very severe cases, the ulcers may be deep enough to puncture the intestinal wall (perforation) resulting in acute inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdomen (peritonitis). Occasionally, the ulcer may diminish lung function. Balantidiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by the single celled (protozoan) parasite Balantidium coli.  This parasite may be passed directly to humans by contact with pig feces or indirectly by drinking contaminated water.  Poor nutrition, a compromised immune system, or other illnesses may make a person vulnerable to more severe symptoms of this disease. Balantidiasis is a rare infection that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It typically occurs in tropical regions such as Brazil, New Guinea, and southern Iran.\n', '"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare infection that means ""decaying infection of the fascia,"" which is the soft tissue that is part of the connective tissue system that runs throughout the body. NF is caused by one or more bacteria that attacks the skin, the tissue just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue), and the fascia causing these tissues to die (necrosis). These infections can be sudden, vicious, and fast-spreading. If not treated quickly with antibiotics and/or debridement of the infected tissue, the patient may develop toxic shock syndrome or toxic shock-like syndrome, which may lead to multiple organ failure and death. Conditions and behaviors that increase the prevalence of poly-microbial NF include obesity, poorly controlled or untreated diabetes, chronic kidney failure, HIV, alcohol abuse, abscess, IV drug use, blunt or penetrating trauma, insect bites, surgical incisions, indwelling catheters, chicken pox, vesicles, and (rarely) perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (Sarani et al). However, everybody is susceptible to NF."\n', 'Selective mutism is a rare psychiatric condition primarily occurring during childhood. It is characterized by the failure to speak in certain social situations. The ability to speak and understand spoken language is not impaired, and may be exhibited in more familiar environments. Symptoms include excessive shyness and social anxiety. Selective mutism is recorded to affect less than one percent of children in the United States. This disorder appears slightly more common in females than in males. The percent of affected population is unknown due to undiagnosis and misdiagnosis.\n', 'Autosomal dominant porencephaly type I affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. Autosomal dominant porencephaly type I may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder.\n', 'MERRF (Myoclonus Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers) syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that begins in childhood and affects the nervous system and skeletal muscle as well as other body systems. The distinguishing feature in MERRF is myoclonus, consisting of sudden, brief, jerking spasms that can affect the arms and legs or the entire body. In addition, individuals with MERRF syndrome may have muscle weakness (myopathy), an impaired ability to coordinate movements (ataxia), seizures, and a slow deterioration of intellectual function (dementia). Short stature, degeneration of the optic nerve (optic atrophy), hearing loss, cardiomyopathy and abnormal sensation from nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy) are also common symptoms. Abnormal muscle cells are present and appear as ragged red fibers (RRF) when stained with the modified Gomori trichrome and viewed microscopically.  MERRF is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MERRF syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.   Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MERRF syndrome.\n', 'Sepiapterin reductase deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 40 cases have been described in the medical literature. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. Because cases can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of the disorder in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Arterial tortuosity syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. Because affected individuals may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of arterial tortuosity syndrome in the general population is difficult. Onset is usually in infancy or early childhood.\n', 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 375 babies are born each year in the United States with an encephalocele. That would be approximately 1 in 10,000 babies each year. Females are more likely to have an encephalocele in the back (occipital area) of the skull, while males are more likely to have one in the front of the skull. In Western populations, encephaloceles are more common in the back of the skull. In Southeast Asia, they are more common in the front of the skull.\n', "Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various toxic materials in the body's cells as a result of enzyme deficiencies. There are nearly 50 of these disorders altogether, and they may affect different parts of the body, including the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and central nervous system. New lysosomal storage disorders continue to be identified. While clinical trials are in progress on possible treatments for some of these diseases, there is currently no approved treatment for many lysosomal storage diseases. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are believed to have an estimated frequency of about one in every 5,000 live births.  Although the individual diseases are rare, the group together affects many people around the world.  Some of the diseases have a higher incidence in certain populations.  For instance, Gaucher and Tay-Sachs diseases are more prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish population.  A mutation associated with Hurler syndrome is known to occur more frequently among Scandinavian and Russian peoples. Prenatal diagnosis is possible for all lysosomal storage disorders. Early detection of lysosomal storage diseases, whether before birth or as soon as possible afterward, is important because when therapies are available, either for the disease itself or for associated symptoms, they may significantly limit the long-term course and impact of the disease.\n", 'The prevalence of ocular albinism has been reported to be one male in 20,000 births. The diagnosis of ocular albinism is based on the characteristic eye findings. Female relatives who carry the gene for ocular albinism will have some retinal pigment abnormalities (seen as mild iris transillumination) but usually will not have the visual changes observed in affected males. Very rarely females can be affected with the hallmarks of OA1 including nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia with reduced visual acuity. Molecular genetic testing for GPR143 gene detects mutations in approximately 90% of affected males and is available to confirm the diagnosis.\n', 'HS affects 1 in 2,000 people in North America. It also occurs in other regions of the world, although not as well studied. No genetic changes that are more common in certain groups of people (founder mutations) have been reported. HS affects males and females equally. Age at diagnosis of HS is often between 3 – 7 years but can occur in infancy with severe disease or into adulthood with mild disease.\n', 'Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) describes a group of diseases that affect the tubules of the kidney. These conditions have the following characteristics: (1) They are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; this means that a parent has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their children. Often many family members are affected. (2) Chronic kidney disease develops. This initially is noticed as an elevated blood creatinine level. There are no symptoms from an elevated creatinine until it is very high, so often the elevated creatinine is found out on blood testing at a doctor’s office or in the hospital. Often, doctors are uncertain why the creatinine is elevated.  As chronic kidney disease progresses, and the creatinine rises more, patients develop symptoms of fatigue, anemia, and feel cold all the time. Decreased appetite and fluid retention develop as the patient nears the need for dialysis. (3) Dialysis or kidney transplant is required sometime between the 4th and 7th decade of life. (4) Several types of the disease are associated with elevated uric acid concentrations in blood and gout, which sometimes starts in the teenage years. In ADTKD-UMOD and ADTKD- REN, some – but not all - family members are affected by gout. All types of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease are very uncommon.\n', 'E.coli In childhood, aHUS affects males and females in equal numbers. In adulthood, females are affected more often than males, most likely because pregnancy is a triggering event. The exact overall incidence and prevalence is unknown. One study placed the incidence in the United States at 2 individuals per 1 million in the general population. In Europe, the disorder is estimated to affect approximately .11 per 1 million individuals between the ages of 0-18. aHUS accounts for approximately 5-10% of all cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n', 'Nocardiosis is an infectious pulmonary disease characterized by abscesses in the lungs. These abscesses may extend through the chest wall. The infection is spread through the body via the bloodstream by a microorganism called Nocardia asteroides. Physical examination usually reveals decreased breath sounds in the lungs and crackles or rales in the infected lung. Cultures of the sputum and/or the fluid in the lungs will prove positive for the Norcardia bacteria. Chest X-rays, CT scans and viewing the lungs through an optical filament (bronchoscopy) can confirm the diagnosis and determine whether abscesses are present.\n', 'Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare digestive disorder characterized by abnormally enlarged (dilatated) lymph vessels supplying the lining of the small intestine. The main symptoms are swelling (edema) of the limbs and abdominal discomfort. The disorder is usually diagnosed before three years of age but is sometimes diagnosed later in life. The cause of PIL is unknown. Multiple affected family members have been reported rarely. PIL is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence is unknown.\n', 'Familial hypophosphatemia is a term that describes a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by impaired kidney conservation of phosphate and in some cases, altered vitamin D metabolism. In contrast, other forms of hypophosphatemia may result from inadequate dietary supply of phosphate, or its poor absorption from the intestines. The chronic hypophosphatemia resulting from these impairments can lead to rickets, a childhood bone disease with characteristic bow deformities of the legs, growth plate abnormalities, and progressive softening of the bone, referred to as osteomalacia.  In children, growth rates may be impaired, frequently resulting in short stature. In adults, the growth plate is not present so that osteomalacia is the evident bone problem. Familial hypophosphatemia is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, however, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of familial hypophosphatemia occur.\n', 'The mitral valve is the valve between the left upper and left lower chambers (left atrium and left ventricle) of the heart. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) is a common condition in which one or both of the flaps (cusps) of the mitral valve bulge or collapse backward (prolapse) into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole). In some cases, this may allow leakage or the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium (mitral regurgitation). Although mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) has been reported in individuals of various ages, it is most commonly noted in young adults.  Estimates indicate that MVP affects approximately four to eight percent of young adults in the general population, with females affected more commonly than males. As noted above, mitral valve prolapse syndrome may occur as an isolated condition or in association with various underlying disorders or syndromes.  For further information, please see the “Causes” section above or use the disease name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) may be diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination, a complete patient and family history, and various tests. The condition is often recognized through use of a stethoscope during routine physical examination, based upon detection of a characteristic clicking sound or sounds (systolic clicks) and/or a subsequent, delayed, high-pitched murmur (late systolic regurgitation murmur). The diagnosis may be confirmed based upon specialized imaging techniques, particularly echocardiography, during which sound waves are directed toward the heart, enabling physicians to identify abnormal positioning and prolapse of the mitral valve flaps. In some cases, additional cardiac and other diagnostic studies may be recommended to help confirm and assess the severity of potentially associated abnormalities, such as accompanying regurgitation.\n', 'Metatropic Dysplasia I is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely small stature, with short arms and legs. Other characteristics of this disorder are a narrow thorax, short ribs, and kyphoscoliosis (backward and sideways curvature of the spinal column) which develops into short trunk dwarfism. Metatropic Dysplasia I is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'The diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and the identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., persistent and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss). The diagnosis is one of exclusion as other causes of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy must be ruled out. Physicians should determine the frequency of nausea and vomiting and the extent to which they affect an affected individual’s daily life.\n', 'PMM2-CDG is the most common of a growing family of more than 100 extremely rare inherited metabolic disorders. More than 800 cases of this specific disorder have been reported worldwide. Two other disorders in this family are each represented by more than 20 cases. The remaining disorders in this family have fewer than 20 cases with several earning a place in the medical literature based on the report of one or two cases. The exact incidence and prevalence of these disorders in the general population is unknown. It is difficult to determine the true frequency of PMM2-CDG in the general population since the disorder may still be under-recognized and under-diagnosed in many parts of the world.\n', 'The gallbladder is a small pear shaped organ that stores and concentrates bile used for digestion of fats. Bile is a compound composed mainly of cholesterol, bile salts and bilirubin, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder during fasting states.  When food is consumed, it is partially digested by the stomach and enters the small intestine, where bile is released by the gallbladder to aid in the breakdown of fats. Gallstones develop when the components of bile, such as cholesterol and bilirubin, remain in the gallbladder and solidify into “pebble-like” material. Gallstones may lodge in the bile ducts and block the release of bile causing a backup. Up to 80% of all gallstones do not cause symptoms but obstruction within the bile ducts can cause gallbladder swelling (distension) and severe pain and tenderness of right side of abdomen and/or back (biliary colic). If the obstruction persists, it results in inflammation, infection, and even lack of blood flow (ischemia), a common condition known as acute cholecystitis, or acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC).  Repeated mild episodes of acute cholecystitis may result in chronic cholecystitis, causing thickening and shrinking of the gallbladder wall resulting in an inability to store bile.\n', 'Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that is detectable before birth (prenatally) and which follows a progressively degenerative path involving several organs of the body but especially the brain. It is characterized by seizures, mental retardation, stunted growth, failure to thrive, unstable body temperature, and very unusual color and texture of hair. Menkes disease is characterized by brittle, tangled, sparse, steely or kinky hair that is often white, ivory, or gray in color.  Unusual facial features include pudgy cheeks and abnormal eyebrows.  Affected infants are often born prematurely. Lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and excess bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) may occur causing a yellow appearance (jaundice). Hypothermia may also occur in older infants.  In some cases, early symptoms may resolve, and normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for two to three months.  Severe developmental delay, loss of early development skills, and convulsions may occur.  Brain abnormalities such as a blood clot at the base of the brain (subdural hematoma) and/or rupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain not infrequently occur. Spastic dementia and seizures may eventually arise.  Weakened bones (osteoporosis) are common and can result in fractures. The combination of subdural hematoma and bone fractures may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of child abuse.  Emphysema, bladder abnormalities, degeneration of the retina and cysts of the iris have also been described. In rare cases, symptoms are very mild and only a few typical symptoms may appear. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of Menkes disease ranges from about 1 in 100,000 live births to 1 in 250,000 live births. Menkes disease is diagnosed by measurement of a decreased amount of copper and ceruloplasmin in blood plasma but these tests are not always reliable in the newborn period.  A new method of diagnosis that can potentially identify affected infants before copper deficiency affects the brain involves measurement of catecholamine levels in blood plasma.   Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the APT7A gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available if a specific ATP7A mutation in an affected family member.\n', 'Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized by the abnormal development of bone (osseousbo dysplasia). Affected individuals exhibit bowing of the long portions (shafts) of the shinbone (tibia) and the outer, smaller bone of the leg below the knee (fibula). In some individuals, other bones may also be affected, such as the ribs, pelvis, spinal column, and/or bones in the arms. Affected individuals will have some degree of short stature, which means that they are shorter than would otherwise be expected based on their gender and age. The medical definition states that short stature is two standard deviations or more below the mean for children of the same age and gender. The final height of affected individuals will vary. Researchers believe that alterations (mutations) in a gene result in Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome. However, they have not been able to find such a gene. Researchers also believe that the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare skeletal disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 70 people have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder’s original description in 1954. However, because rare disorders like Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Duodenal atresia or stenosis is a rare congenital digestive disorder that usually occurs for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, a few cases of duodenal atresia have been inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Duodenal atresia or stenosis is a rare disorder that occurs in approximately 1 of 7,500 live births to 1 of 40,000 live births.  In Finland, the rate goes up to 1 case per 3,400 live births.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers.\n', "Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is a rare genetic degenerative disorder affecting the brain and spinal cord, or central nervous system (neurodegenerative disorder). Affected individuals display poor attention and concentration, declining work or academic performance, and language difficulties. Eventually, they experience a decline in their intellectual abilities (dementia). Memory, however, is relatively well-preserved early in the course of the disease compared to the severe memory deficits that are typical of Alzheimer's disease. Some affected individuals develop additional symptoms such as uncontrolled, irregular muscle contractions and seizures. Changes in mood, such as apathy, depression, or anger frequently occur. Eventually, affected individuals require comprehensive medical care. FENIB affects males and females in equal numbers. Only a few families with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. FENIB was originally described in the medical literature in 1999. The incidence of FENIB in the general population is unknown. The age of onset of FENIB can be as early as the first decade or as late as the fifth or sixth.\n", 'Werner syndrome is a rare progressive disorder that is characterized by the appearance of unusually accelerated aging (progeria). Although the disorder is typically recognized by the third or fourth decades of life, certain characteristic findings are present beginning during adolescence and early adulthood. Werner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1904 (O. Werner), more than 800 cases have been reported. The disorder’s frequency has been estimated at one to 20 per one million individuals in the United States. Although certain associated findings are present beginning during childhood, puberty, and young adulthood, the disorder is most frequently recognized in the third or fourth decades of life.\n', 'Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by various physical abnormalities affecting the head and facial (craniofacial) area, the skin, the fingers, and the genitals. In addition, affected individuals may have malformations of the nipples and the abdominal wall. Infants and children with AMS may also experience delays in language development and, in some cases, mental retardation. Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS) is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital).  The disorder was originally described in 1977 (McCarthy GT) in two unrelated male children.  A few additional isolated cases have since been recorded in the medical literature.  In addition, investigators have described familial AMS in the sister of a previously reported affected female whose father has more minor features of the syndrome.\n', "Huntington's disease is a genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual development of involuntary muscle movements affecting the hands, feet, face, and trunk and progressive deterioration of cognitive processes and memory (dementia). Neurologic movement abnormalities may include uncontrolled, irregular, rapid, jerky movements (chorea) and athetosis, a condition characterized by relatively slow, writhing involuntary movements. Dementia is typically associated with progressive disorientation and confusion, personality disintegration, impairment of memory control, restlessness, agitation, and other symptoms and findings. In individuals with the disorder, disease duration may range from approximately 10 years up to 25 years or more. Life-threatening complications may result from pneumonia or other infections, injuries related to falls, or other associated developments. About 30,000 people in the United States have Huntington’s disease and another 200,000 are at risk of developing the condition. Symptoms commonly develop between ages 30 and 50. The disease progresses slowly and a person may live for another 15-20 years after the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis of Huntington's disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Specialized x-ray studies such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or electroencephalography (EEG) may help confirm the diagnosis of Huntington's Disease. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a file showing cross-sectional images of the brain. During MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves are used to create cross-sectional images of the brain. During an EEG, an instrument records electrical activity of the brain. Neuropsychological and/or genetic tests are also used to aid the diagnosis of Huntington's disease.\n", 'LGMD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder is unknown. The prevalence of LGMD is unknown, but estimates range from one in 14,500 to one in 123,000. The age of onset can vary greatly even among individuals of the same family. The relative frequencies of the different types of LGMD vary from population to population, but worldwide LGMD2G, 2H and 2J are extremely rare.\n', 'Aspartylglycosaminuria is a very rare genetic disorder that is concentrated among persons of Finnish decent, but is also found, even more rarely, in other populations around the world. It is an inborn error of metabolism, and one of the lysosomal storage diseases. It becomes apparent after the infant is a few months old. Major symptoms may include coarse facial features, spine and eye deformities, behavior problems and mental retardation. Aspartylglycosaminuria occurs as a result of deficient activity of a particular enzyme, leading to the accumulation of metabolic products in the body. Aspartylglycosaminuria is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by normal development during the first months of life after which abnormal development begins to occur.  Diarrhea and infections that keep reoccurring are noticed. After the first few years facial features begin to get coarse which continues during the following years.  The skeleton may become deformed and the ocular lens may develop crystalline deposits.  Mental deterioration may begin to occur after age five and behavior problems are common.  Lung, heart and blood problems tend to occur in later years.  The patient may show mental retardation uneven development of the head and face with sagging cheeks, a wide nose and broad face.  The spine may be twisted (scoliosis) and the neck may be unusually short.  Adult stature is usually below normal. Aspartylglycosaminuria is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  However, in Finland where the majority of cases are reported, there are an estimated 130 cases in 4.5 million persons.  In the rest of the world, the condition is extremely rare and affects persons of various heritages. Treatment of Aspartylglycosaminuria is symptomatic and supportive. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for families.\n', 'Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is found in all ethnic groups. More than 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. In the general population, the disorder occurs in approximately one to four individuals per million. However, determining the incidence or prevalence of rare disorder is extremely difficult. Skin abnormalities associated with this disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or by the age of five. Other symptoms usually become apparent between the third and fifth year of life.\n', 'Roberts syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Roberts syndrome is unknown.\n', 'Spondylothoracic dysplasia occurs with greater frequency in Puerto Rico and in individuals of Puerto Rican heritage, accounting for about half of all affected individuals reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Achard-Thiers syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs primarily in postmenopausal women and is characterized by type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes mellitus and signs of androgen excess. The exact cause of this syndrome is unknown. These syndromes appear to be transmitted within families.  Approximately 50% of the sisters of women with PCOS have some form of the syndrome.  The exact mechanism of genetic transmission is unknown. Achard-Thiers Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects females after menopause.  The incidence of this disorder in the general population is not known. The diagnosis of Achard-Thiers syndrome should be suspected based on the clinical findings. Because affected women are hyperinsulinemic, a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test shows abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood.\n', 'Barth syndrome affects all ethnic groups. The incidence of Barth syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 300,000 to 1 in 400,00 in United States. As of 2013, there have been 151 patients reported in the medical literature.\n', 'Chromosome 21 Ring is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the affected infant has a breakage of chromosome 21 at both ends, and the ends of the chromosome join together to form a ring. The amount of genetic material lost at the two ends of the chromosome may vary. As a result, an infant with very little absent genetic material may have no apparent symptoms while an infant with a significant part of the chromosomal ends missing may have many symptoms. When symptoms of the disorder are present, the affected infant may have mental retardation as well as abnormalities of the face, eyes, skeleton, and/or internal organs. Chromosome 21 Ring is a rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'Malaria is a communicable parasitic disorder spread through the bite of the Anopheles mosquito. Major symptoms may vary depending on which species of parasite causes the infection and the stage of development of the parasite. Chills and fever commonly occur, although not every case follows the same pattern.  Although the disorder was once thought to be under control throughout the world, malaria is a widespread infection especially in the tropics where certain types of mosquitos are becoming resistant to pesticides. The annual number of cases reported in the United States has increased in recent years. Malaria is most commonly transmitted through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito which is infected by a malaria parasite (Plasmodium).  Plasmodium Falciparum, Plasmodium Ovale, Plasmodium Malariae and Plasmodium Vivax are the four species of the parasite which can affect humans.  Additionally, transfusion of blood from an infected donor, or sharing contaminated needles may transmit the infection from one person to another.  In very rare cases, the disorder has been transmitted from an infected mother to a fetus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, malaria is uncommon in the United States where approximately 1,200 cases are diagnosed each year, usually having been contracted abroad.  In the United States, malaria results in two to five deaths, on the average, each year.  Most cases in the U.S. occur among travelers, immigrants, and refugees.\n', 'Tethered cord syndrome is a stretch-induced functional disorder associated with the fixation (tethering) effect of inelastic tissue on the caudal spinal cord, limiting its movement. This abnormal attachment is associated with progressive stretching and increased tension of the spinal cord as a child ages, potentially resulting in a variety of neurological and other symptoms. Due to the variation of the growth rate of the spinal cord and the spinal column, the progression of neurological signs and symptoms is highly variable. Some individuals present with tethered cord syndrome at birth (so-called congenital), while others develop the symptomatology in infancy or early childhood. Other individuals may not develop any noticeable symptoms until adulthood. Although some authors call these cases acquired, the majority of these cases are mostly developmental, corresponding to the progressive development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the filum terminale. The filum terminale is a strand of tissue that bridges the spinal cord tip and the tailbone (sacrum). The inelastic structures in children originated from defective closure of the neural tube (the precursor of the spinal cord) during embryonic development, eventually forming a condition known as spina bifida. Because of its functional (physiological) nature, tethered cord syndrome can be reversible if surgically treated in its early stage.\n', 'Tooth and nail syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasia, which group consists of more than 100 separate recognized syndromes. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the teeth, nails, hair, and/or skin. Tooth and nail syndrome is characterized by absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain primary (deciduous) and secondary (permanent) teeth occurring in association with improper development (dysplasia) of the nails, particularly the toenails. In some cases, tooth and nail syndrome may be suspected at birth if one or more toenails and/or fingernails are absent. More commonly, the disorder is detected at approximately four or five years of age, when the absence of certain primary (deciduous) teeth and underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of nails may be noted. In some cases, a diagnosis of tooth and nail syndrome may not be confirmed until approximately seven to 15 years of age, when absence and malformation of several secondary (permanent) teeth and nail dysplasia has been verified. A diagnosis of tooth and nail syndrome is confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and the identification of characteristic physical findings.\n', 'Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence is estimated to occur in 1 in 13,700 individuals in the general population. Because people who are mildly affected may go undiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of BWS in the general population.\n', 'In Europe the prevalence of symptomatic AIP is reported to be 5.9 per million people in the general population., It is likely to be similar elsewhere in the world apart from Sweden where it is higher due to a founder effect. Recent population based genetic studies have shown that approximately 1 in 2000 of the population inherit a disease causing (pathogenic) mutation in the HMBS gene. This suggests that only 1% of those who inherit a pathogenic mutation will ever experience porphyria symptoms. AIP can occur in individuals of all ethnic backgrounds, although it may be less frequently reported in African-American individuals. Women are affected by symptomatic AIP more often than men. The disorder is most common in young or middle-aged women.\n', 'Ocular melanoma is an extremely rare form of cancer that affects the eye with an incidence of 5 per million adults. Although rare, it is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. Primary means that the cancer began at that site (in this case the eye) and did not spread there from another part of the body. In most people, this cancer arises in a part of the eye known as the uveal tract. The uveal tract is the colored (pigmented) layer of tissue that is found beneath the white of the eye (sclera) and is composed of normally pigmented cells and blood vessels.  In the front of the eye, the uvea is made up of the colored part of the eye (iris) and a circle of muscle tissue (ciliary body) that releases a transparent fluid (aqueous humor) into the eye and helps to control the shape of the lens. The largest area of the uveal tract is in the back part of the eye (choroid) which is located beneath the retina, the vision sensing portion of the eye. In most instances, ocular melanomas arise within the choroid. Ocular melanoma arises from cells called melanocytes, which are the cells of the body that produce pigment. Ocular melanoma is a cancerous (malignant) tumor that can potentially spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most often to the liver. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified. Ocular melanoma is the most common primary cancer affecting the eye. However, it is a rare disorder and is estimated to be diagnosed in about 2,500 people in the United States each year. The incidence is unknown, but one estimate places it at about 5-6 people per every 1,000,000 people in the general population. This cancer can affect men and women and individuals of all ethnic or racial groups. It occurs most commonly in older individuals with the highest incidence in the seventh and eighth decade of life. However, ocular melanoma has been reported in children as well. The disorder occurs more often in people who are fair skinned and have lighter colored eyes. The rate of occurrence is 8-10 times higher in Caucasian individuals compared to people of African descent. Ocular melanoma accounts for about 3-4% of all people with melanoma and is less common than melanoma of the skin.\n', 'The diagnosis of babesiosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history (e.g., recent tick bite), characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as the examination of blood smears that screen for the parasite inside red blood cells (erythrocytes). The diagnosis may also be confirmed by antibody testing (indirect immunofluorescent assay).\n', 'Geographic tongue is a benign condition characterized by inflammation of the tongue (glossitis) that appears in a map-like (geographic) pattern. The normal tongue is covered by a layer of small bumps known as papillae. In affected individuals, certain areas of the tongue are missing these bumps. These affected areas usually appear as smooth, red or pink colored, degenerated (atrophic) patches. Geographic tongue tends to come and go it usually heals without treatment, but will recur again usually affecting a different area of the tongue. Most cases are not associated with any symptoms (asymptomatic) and the condition usually goes away without treatment. Geographic tongue is not associated with any long-term health complications in healthy individuals. The exact cause of geographic tongue is unknown. Some reports in the medical literature suggest that geographic tongue affects females slightly more often than males.  It appears to occur with greater frequency in young adults. The prevalence of geographic tongue is unknown, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 3 percent of the general population. A diagnosis of geographic tongue is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and the characteristic appearance of the tongue lesions associated with this disorder. In most cases, surgical removal and microscopic study (biopsy) of affected tissue is not necessary because of the distinct appearance of the tongue.\n', 'Refsum disease is one of a family of genetic disorders known as the leukodystrophies in which, as a consequence of the disruption of lipid metabolism, the myelin sheath that insulates and protects the nerves of the brain fails to grow. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is characterized by progressive loss of vision (retinitis pigmentosa); degenerative nerve disease (peripheral neuropathy); failure of muscle coordination (ataxia); and dry, rough, scaly skin (ichthyosis). The age of onset of Refsum disease varies greatly.  It may occur at any time from early childhood until around 50 years of age, but in most symptoms will have appeared by age 20.  Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The presence of phytanic acid in blood or urine samples is diagnostic.\n', 'BOR/BOS syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated that 1 in 40,000 people have this disorder. BOR/BOS syndrome is found in approximately 2 to 3 percent of children with profound deafness.\n', 'In North America, the incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease is rising, particularly among the elderly. Generally, NTM infection is more common in Caucasians, Asians and individuals with a compromised immune system. The incidence and prevalence rates reported in the medical literature varies and because many cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed determining the true frequency of NTM infections in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Sweet syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by fever and the sudden onset of a rash, which consists of multiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps or lesions. These lesions usually occur on the arms, legs, trunk, face or neck. In some cases, additional systems of the body can become involved including the musculoskeletal system such as inflammation of the joints (arthritis), the eyes such as inflammation of the conjunctiva or the membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctivitis), and the internal organs. In the majority of affected individuals, the disorder occurs by itself for no known reason (idiopathic Sweet syndrome); this is also known as classical Sweet syndrome. Less often, the disorder can be associated with an underlying cancer (malignancy), usually a blood (hematologic) cancer such as certain types of leukemia; this is known as malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. The disorder can also result as a reaction to taking certain drugs, especially a drug known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; this is known as drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is treated with corticosteroids. Classical Sweet syndrome in adults affects women more often than men by as much as 15:1 by some estimates. This female preponderance has not been seen in malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Classical Sweet syndrome usually affects women between the ages of 30-50, but can be seen in individuals of any age including children. There is no gender predominance seen in children. Several hundred individuals of Sweet syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Only approximately 80 children have been reported in the medical literature. A diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of classic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. In many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue may reveal the infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis. A complete blood cell count may also show neutrophils in the blood (neutrophilia).\n', 'Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, regulates blood sugar levels by promoting the movement of glucose (a simple sugar) into cells for energy production or into the liver and fat cells for storage. Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is unknown. Because rare disorders like Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome in the general population.\n', 'Eales Disease is a rare disorder of sight that appears as an inflammation and white haze around the outercoat of the veins in the retina. The disorder is most prevalent among young males and normally affects both eyes. Usually, vision is suddenly blurred because the clear jelly that fills the eyeball behind the lens of the eye seeps out (vitreous hemorrhaging). The exact case of Eales Disease is not known.  This disorder seems to occur spontaneously because no precipitating factors such as injury, infection, or heredity appear to be involved. Eales Disease is a rare disorder that affect males and females in equal numbers.\n', 'Factor XII deficiency affects persons of Asian descent more often than individuals of other ethnicities. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Since no symptoms are usually associated with factor XII deficiency, many individuals remain undiagnosed. The exact incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown, but estimated to be approximately 1 in 1 million individuals.\n', 'Schinzel syndrome, also known as ulnar-mammary syndrome, is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormalities of the bones of the hands and forearms in association with underdevelopment (hypoplasia) and dysfunction of certain sweat (apocrine) glands and/or the breasts (mammary glands). Abnormalities affecting the hands and/or forearms range from underdevelopment of the bone in the tip of the fifth finger (hypoplastic terminal phalanx) to underdevelopment or complete absence of the bone on the outer aspect of the forearm (ulna). In some cases, a diagnosis of Schinzel syndrome may be made at birth based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, the identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized imaging techniques. Such imaging studies may be conducted to confirm and/or characterize bone abnormalities affecting the fingers, hands, wrists, and/or arms; certain genital abnormalities (e.g., bicornate uterus in females, cryptorchidism in males); and/or other malformations (e.g., pyloric stenosis, inguinal hernia). Specialized tests may also be conducted to detect and verify dysfunction of certain sweat (apocrine) glands and/or the mammary glands in affected females. In addition, in some cases, additional testing may be conducted (e.g., echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, cardiac catheterization, specialized x-ray studies, etc.) to detect the presence of and/or characterize ventricular septal defects, which have been reported in one family with the disorder.\n', 'Blastomycosis is a rare infectious multisystem disease that is caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The symptoms vary greatly according the affected organ system. It is characterized by fever, chills, cough, and/or difficulty breathing (dyspnea). In the chronic phase of the disease, the lungs and skin are most frequently affected. The genitourinary tract and bones may also be involved. Blastomycosis is a rare infectious disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis.  This fungus grows and is inhaled through mold spores.  In the body the fungus converts to yeasts and invades the lungs.  It travels throughout the body through the blood.  Blastomycosis usually affects people with a compromised immune system.\n', 'Scott craniodigital syndrome is a condition that has only been found in two families. The manifestations include unusual head shape, growth and developmental delay, and mild webbing between the fingers and toes (syndactyly) Scott Craniodigital Syndrome With Mental Retardation is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is fully expressed in males only.  However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygotes) may exhibit some of the symptoms associated with the disorder.  The disorder has been reported in two separate families (kindreds) in the medical literature.  Most of the symptoms are apparent at birth.\n', 'Dubin Johnson Syndrome is a rare genetic liver disorder that tends to affect people of Middle Eastern Jewish heritage disproportionately to other groups. It appears to be associated with clotting factor VII in this population. Symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender. Jaundice, which is caused by excess bilirubin (bile pigment), is usually the only symptom of Dubin Johnson Syndrome.  Otherwise a physical examination is normal.  The disorder rarely appears before puberty.  Occasionally the patient may have an enlarged and tender liver and complain of weakness and a painful abdomen, but the liver will function normally. There may sometimes be a mild recurrence of the jaundice. Pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives may cause the disease to become apparent in women when no symptoms appeared previously. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The disorder can occur in all races.  However, among Iranian, Iraqi and Moroccan Jews the incidence is as high as 1 in 1300.  In Japan an unusually high incidence of Dubin-Johnson Syndrome was found in an isolated area where there was a high rate of intermarriage.  Age at onset can be anytime between 10 weeks of age to 56 years. Treatment of Dubin Johnson Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. In many cases patients may require no treatment even though they have recurrent mild jaundice. However, metabolism of certain drugs may be affected in patients with Dubin-Johnson Syndrome since many pharmaceutical products are metabolized in the liver. Therefore, medications should be carefully supervised by a physician. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families affected by Dubin Johnson Syndrome.\n', "The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are rare disorders characterized by the premature destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells at a rate faster than they can be replaced. Acquired hemolytic anemias are non-genetic in origin. Idiopathic acquired autoimmune diseases occur when the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (e.g., lymphocytes, antibodies) destroy its own healthy tissues for no known reason. Normally, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a life span of approximately 120 days before being removed by the spleen. The severity of this type of anemia is determined by the life span of the red blood cell and by the rate at which these cells are replaced by the bone marrow. When acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs from unknown causes, it affects twice as many women as men, specifically women under 50 years old. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects elderly persons, and warm antibody hemolytic anemia can affect anyone at any age. Upon suspicion of hemolytic anemia, blood will be tested to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells to mature ones. If the ratio is high, hemolytic anemia is likely. Another blood test (Coombs test) is used to determine whether the amount of certain antibodies is higher than normal. If so, the diagnosis may be autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n", 'Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most frequent cause of severe, persistent hypoglycemia in newborn babies, infants, and children. In most countries it occurs in approximately 1/25,000 to 1/50,000 births. About 60% of babies with HI are diagnosed during the first month of life. An additional 30% will be diagnosed later in the first year and the remainder after that. With early treatment and aggressive prevention of hypoglycemia, brain damage can be prevented. However, brain damage can occur in children with HI if the condition is not recognized or if treatment is ineffective in the prevention of hypoglycemia. It is often difficult to identify symptoms of HI because they are often confused with typical behaviors of newborns and infants. Common symptoms include irritability, sleepiness, lethargy, excessive hunger and rapid heart rate. More severe symptoms, such as seizures and coma, can occur with a prolonged or extremely low blood sugar level. Common symptoms of low blood sugar in older children and adults include feelings of shakiness, weakness, or tiredness, confusion and rapid pulse. More severe symptoms include seizures or coma. HI affects both males and females and has been reported in many countries. In most countries it occurs in approximately 1/25,000 to 1/50,000 births.\n', '"TORCH Syndrome refers to infection of a developing fetus or newborn by any of a group of infectious agents. ""TORCH"" is an acronym meaning (T)oxoplasmosis, (O)ther Agents, (R)ubella (also known as German Measles), (C)ytomegalovirus, and (H)erpes Simplex. Infection with any of these agents (i.e., Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses) may cause a constellation of similar symptoms in affected newborns. These may include fever; difficulties feeding; small areas of bleeding under the skin, causing the appearance of small reddish or purplish spots; enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); yellowish discoloration of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice); hearing impairment; abnormalities of the eyes; and/or other symptoms and findings. Each infectious agent may also result in additional abnormalities that may be variable, depending upon a number of factors (e.g., stage of fetal development). TORCH Syndrome results from one of the TORCH agents having crossed the placenta during pregnancy.  These infectious agents include Toxoplasma gondii, the single-celled microorganism (protozoa) responsible for Toxoplasmosis; rubella virus; cytomegalovirus; and herpes simplex viruses.  (Note: According to some reports, the acronym “TORCH” is sometimes modified to the term “STORCH” to include syphilis, a disease that may result in symptoms similar to those associated with the other TORCH agents.  Syphilis is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum.  In addition, TORCH may encompass other disease-causing agents, such as varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus responsible for chickenpox, and parvovirus.) TORCH syndrome may affect a developing fetus or newborn, potentially resulting in miscarriage, delayed fetal growth and maturation (intrauterine growth retardation), or early delivery. Treatment of newborns and infants with TORCH Syndrome is based upon the specific causative agent, the stage of fetal development when infection initially occurred, the severity of the infection and associated symptoms and findings, and/or other factors. For infants with toxoplasmosis, treatment may include administration of the medication pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine. Herpes simplex may be treated with the antiviral agent acyclovir. The treatment of newborns and infants with rubella or cytomegalovirus primarily includes symptomatic and supportive measures."\n', 'Patients with Marshall Syndrome have a distinctive flat sunken midface with a flattened nasal bridge (saddle nose), nostrils that turn upward, and a wide space between the eyes (hypertelorism). The dome-like upper portion of the skull (calvaria) is thicker than normal and calcium deposits can be found in the skull (cranium).\xa0 Frontal sinuses may be absent. Eye defects found in patients with Marshall Syndrome are nearsightedness, a disease of the eye in which the lens loses its clarity (cataract), and a wide space between the eyes making the eyeballs appear to be larger than normal. Hearing loss may range from slight to severe; the distortion of the sound is a consequence of the nerve damage (sensorineural). Other symptoms exhibited by some patients with Marshall Syndrome are: crossed eyes (esotropia), a condition in which the line of vision is higher in one eye than the other (hypertropia), retinal detachment, glaucoma, protruding upper incisors (teeth) and a smaller than normal or missing nasal bone. Marshall Syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Plastic surgery can improve saddle nose in Marshall syndrome. Other surgical procedures are used to remove the lenses of eyes affected by cataracts, after which lens implants are used as replacements. Subsequently, contact lenses may help improve sharpness of vision. Laser techniques are used to loosen any material, such as the cornea or the lens capsule that may adhere to the lens. The use of a hearing aid may be beneficial in some cases. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.\n', 'Fox-Fordyce disease is a rare skin disorder that primarily affects women. The disorder is characterized by intense itching especially in the underarm area, the pubic area and around the nipples. In Fox-Fordyce disease abnormalities affecting the apocrine sweat glands causes inflammation, and enlargement of the glands and the characteristic intense itching. Skin near an affected area may become darkened and dry and multiple, small, raised bumps (papules) may develop. Hair follicles in the affected area can become secondarily damaged, resulting in hair loss. The exact cause of Fox-Fordyce disease is unknown. Fox-Fordyce disease occurs primarily in women between 13 and 35 years of age. However, in rare cases, it can affect men and children and women who are post-menopausal. Some reports place the ration of affected women to men at 9:1. The incidence of Fox-Fordyce disease is unknown. Heat, humidity, stress and exercise have been noted as exacerbating factors. In addition, Fox-Fordyce disease may be more severe during menstruation and tends to disappear (spontaneously resolve) during pregnancy. Fox-Fordyce disease was first described in the medical literature in 1902. A diagnosis of Fox-Fordyce disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (i.e., papular eruptions on apocrine gland areas), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected tissue may be useful in obtaining a diagnosis. An experienced dermatopathologist will be necessary to correctly diagnose the disease from a biopsy.\n', 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a group of rare disorders affecting the connective tissue and characterized by extremely fragile bones that break or fracture easily (brittle bones), often without apparent cause. The specific symptoms and physical findings associated with OI vary greatly from case to case. The severity of OI also varies greatly, even among individuals of the same family. OI may be a mild disorder or may result in severe complications. Four main types of OI have been identified. OI type I is the most common and the mildest form of the disorder. OI type II is the most severe. In most cases, the various forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Osteogenesis imperfecta affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of individuals with OI in the United States (prevalence) is unknown. OI type I is estimated to occur in one in 30,000 live births. OI type II is estimated to occur in one in 60,000 live births. The overall prevalence of all types of OI is estimated at .5 per 10,000 individuals in the United States. Approximately 20,000 to 50,000 individuals in the United States have OI.\n', 'Since the disorder was originally described in 1981 (T.R. Gollop) in a brother and sister, fewer than 10 cases of frontofacionasal dysplasia have been reported in the medical literature. The two siblings as well as the third individual reported with the disorder are of Brazilian descent.\n', 'Simpson dysmorphia syndrome types 1 and 2 are two forms of a rare, X-linked recessive, inherited disorder characterized by unusually large fetuses (prenatal overgrowth) and unusually large babies (postnatal overgrowth). In addition, affected individuals have characteristic facial features, more than two nipples (super-numerary nipples), and multisystemic malformations that may vary from child to child. Chief among these are cardiac malformations, mild to moderate mental retardation, cleft palate, and more than the five fingers and/or toes (polydactyly). Simpson dysmorphia syndrome is apparent at birth (congenital).  The syndrome has been diagnosed only in males, although the carrier females may display symptoms to varying degrees.  Between 10 and 20 affected families with SDYS1 have been recorded in the medical literature. The variant SDYS2 has been recorded in 1 family.\n', 'Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is a rare neurological disorder that originates in the brain. It is the most common form of focal dystonia in an office setting. Cervical dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the neck that cause abnormal movements and postures of the neck and head. In some cases, these abnormal contractions may be sustained or continuous; in others, they may be present as spasms that can resemble tremor. The severity of cervical dystonia can vary, but the disorder can cause significant pain and discomfort as well as difficulty due to the abnormal postures. It can affect quality of life and activities of daily living including employment. Cervical dystonia typically begins in middle age, and rarely begins in adolescence and young adulthood. The cause of cervical dystonia is unknown, although a genetic susceptibility is thought to underlie some cases. If cervical dystonia begins in infancy or early childhood, secondary causes should be investigated. Cervical dystonia affects women approximately twice as often as men. It is the most common form of focal dystonia in an office setting. Cervical dystonia may affect individuals of any age, but typically develops in people between 40 and 60 years of age. Cervical dystonia affects people of all ethnic backgrounds. The exact incidence or prevalence of cervical dystonia in the general population is unknown but is estimated to be about 60,000 people in the United States. A diagnosis of cervical dystonia is based upon clinical examination, a detailed patient history, and knowledge of the disorder. No specific laboratory or imaging test confirms a diagnosis of cervical dystonia. There are no abnormalities in laboratory or imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is normal, and MRI of the neck does not help with the diagnosis unless compression of the spinal cord is suspected. Electromyography is not indicated unless there are additional signs of nerve irritation.\n', '"Roussy-Lévy Syndrome, also known as hereditary areflexic dystasia, is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that typically becomes apparent during early childhood. The disorder is characterized by incoordination, poor judgment of movements (sensory ataxia), and absence of reflexes (areflexia) of the lower legs and, eventually, the hands; weakness and degeneration (atrophy) of muscles of the lower legs; abnormally high arches of the feet with increased extension of the toes (pes cavus or ""clawfoot""); and tremors of the hands. Many affected individuals also have an abnormal front-to-back and sideways curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis). In individuals with Roussy-Lévy Syndrome, there is a failed communication of certain nerve signals to muscles of the lower legs (denervation). Roussy-Levy Syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Symptoms of Roussy-Lévy Syndrome are similar to other hereditary motor sensory neuropathies in that there is weakness and atrophy of the leg muscles with some loss of feeling.  People with this syndrome have difficulty walking and a lack of reflexes and deformity of the foot or feet (pes cavus). Roussy-Lévy differs, however, from other hereditary motor sensory neuropathies because of the very early onset of the disorder during childhood and its slowly progressive course.  Roussy-Lévy also has as one of its characteristics a slight tremor in the hands. Roussy-Lévy is a rare disorder that affects both sexes in equal numbers. Onset is during early childhood. Treatment of Roussy-Lévy Syndrome may include use of braces for the foot deformity or orthopedic surgery on the feet to correct the imbalance of the affected muscles. Genetic counseling may be of benefit to patients and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive."\n', 'Truncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease that is present at birth (congenital) in which there is a single main blood vessel, rather than the normal two, carrying blood away from the heart. Instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. Blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body. Babies with this condition may have a bluish tint (cyanosis) to their skin, lips, and fingernails. In most cases, truncus arteriosus occurs in conjunction with a missing upper portion of the wall between the ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is not known.  It has been suggested that some cases may develop due to the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).  The malformation is the result of an error in embryonic development.  Approximately 35 percent of children with this disorder also have DiGeorge syndrome, which is a severe congenital immune deficiency disorder involving the thymus and parathyroid glands.  (For more information on DiGeorge Syndrome, see the Related Disorders Section of this report.) The diagnosis of truncus arteriosus is confirmed by clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (EKG), and specialized imaging techniques that allow the physician to view the structure of the heart. These may include an echocardiogram, angiocardiogram, and/or cardiac catheterization.\n', 'NAGS deficiency is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In most cases, onset of symptoms occurs at, or shortly following, birth. The estimated frequency of urea cycle disorders collectively is one in 30,000 births. However, because urea cycle disorders like NAGS deficiency often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of urea cycle disorders in the general population.\n', 'Mastocytosis affects males and females in equal numbers. It can begin during childhood or adulthood. Childhood-onset disease most commonly presents within the first two years of life.\n', 'EEC syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown.\n', 'The diagnosis of KCNQ2E is ultimately made by molecular genetic testing. This can be done by examining only the potassium channel gene or by sending testing that looks for sequence changes in a number of genes associated with epilepsy in infancy.\n', 'Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disorder characterized by overproduction (proliferation) of white blood cells called lymphocytes (lymphoproliferative disorder). The abnormal cells infiltrate and accumulate (form lesions or nodules) within tissues. The lesions or nodules damage or destroy the blood vessels within these tissues. The lungs are most commonly affected in lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Symptoms often include cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and chest tightness. Other areas of the body such as the skin, kidneys or central nervous system are also frequently affected.\n', 'Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis is an extremely rare form of ichthyosis that was first described in South Africa but has subsequently been identified in other countries. In such cases, a link to South Africa has been determined. The disorder is characterized by periodic attacks of red (erythematous) plaques that are distributed equally on both sides of the body. A layer of skin can be peeled from these plaques. Symptoms usually improve with age. The disorder tends to become worse with the cold weather. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis is characterized by periodic attacks of red skin plaques.  A thick layer of skin can be peeled off these plaques from the center outward.  As new skin forms, the plaques are pushed outward.  Symptoms may start during infancy or adolescence, and the disorder usually improves with age.  Only the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved in most cases.  However, the disorder may spread to the skin of the back or elsewhere on the body surface.  Appearance of new plaques may be precipitated by fever or surgery. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis primarily affects descendants of farmers from the Oudtshoorn district in South Africa.  This disorder starts during infancy or adolescence and usually improves after age 30. It is thought to affect males and females equally. One estimate is that 37 babies are born with this disorder annually. In most instances, the appearance of the skin determines the diagnosis, but a family history and physical examination are often required to rule out other possible causes of scaly, dry skin. Some physicians may examine skin tissue under a light microscope or even under an electron microscope.\n', 'Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder that affects the skin and internal organs of the body. Multiple distinctive skin lesions are usually characteristic of this disorder and are often present at birth or present during early childhood. Lesions in the gastrointestinal tract frequently become apparent during childhood or early adulthood. The lesions are multifocal venous malformations, resulting from abnormal embryonic blood vessel development. BRBNS is characterized by soft, elevated lesions on the skin or just under the skin that are dark blue, red, purple-red or black in color. The venous malformations may be tender, contain blood and be easily compressed and are usually located on the upper limbs, trunk and soles of the feet but can occur anywhere. The lesions increase in size and become more apparent over time but have not been reported to become cancerous. The organ system most commonly affected by BRBNS is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly the small intestine. The lesions in the GI tract often bleed and can lead to mild or severe anemia. Iron replacement and/or frequent blood transfusions may be required. The GI lesions can also cause an obstruction or blockage (intussusception) of part of the bowel. Skeletal abnormalities and venous malformations in muscle are sometimes associated with BRBNS. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is sporadic.  Although families have been described in which the condition follows autosomal dominant inheritance, these families actually have other multifocal venous malformations. Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature. BRBNS is diagnosed by physical examination and a procedure in which the GI tract is illuminated and visualized (endoscopy). Genetic testing for BRBNS is available on a research basis only.\n', 'CLOVES syndrome is rare and evident at birth. It affects males and females equally regardless of their race or ethnicity. Many of the patients with CS are misdiagnosed as having other syndromes such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Proteus syndrome.\n', 'Bilateral Renal Agenesis is the absence of both kidneys at birth.  It is a genetic disorder characterized by a failure of the kidneys to develop in a fetus. This absence of kidneys causes a deficiency of amniotic fluid (Oligohydramnios) in a pregnant woman. Normally, the amniotic fluid acts as a cushion for the developing fetus. When there is an insufficient amount of this fluid, compression of the fetus may occur resulting in further malformations of the baby. Bilateral renal agenesis is found in male infants more frequently than females.  It tends to occur in the children of parents having kidney abnormalities.  It is a very rare disorder. Treatment of bilateral renal agenesis is symptomatic and supportive.\n', 'Hispanics have a higher incidence of diffuse LCH involvement and Blacks are less affected. (Riberio) The overall incidence of LCH is between 4 and 9 cases per million with males slightly more affected than females (1.2:1) and the highest number of cases presenting in the first four years of life. The diagnostic work-up may include X-rays of the skull, a complete skeletal bone survey and PET scan, chest x-ray, complete blood count and differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and albumin; electrolytes and urinalysis. (Phillips) CT of the skull if mastoids involved. Pulmonary disease: high resolution CT. Brain: MRI. Diabetes insipidus: water deprivation test or serum and urine osmolality.\n', 'Atrioventricular septal defect (ASVD) is a general term for a group of rare heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). Infants with ASVDs have improperly developed atrial and ventricular septa and adjoining valves. The diagnosis of atrioventricular septal defect can be made by imaging techniques of the heart such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiogram (EC). In another procedure known as a cardiac catheterization, a long fine tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and then channeled directly into the heart. This allows the physician to determine the extent of the defect (i.e., complete, transitional, or incomplete) and to determine the rate of blood flow through the heart. Angiography is another useful diagnostic procedure and allows the physician to view an enhanced x-ray of the heart. Children with ASVD typically have an abnormal EKG reading.\n', 'Ectodermal Dysplasias are a group of rare disorders that may affect males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated the approximately 125,000 individuals in the United States are carriers for some form of the disease.\n', 'Myoclonus is the term used to describe the sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles caused by muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or muscle relaxation (negative myoclonus). The twitching or jerking of muscles cannot be controlled by the person experiencing it. Myoclonic jerks may occur infrequently or many times a minute. They sometimes occur in response to an external event or when a person attempts to make a movement. By itself, myoclonus may be seen as a symptom rather than a disease. To some degree, it may occur occasionally to otherwise healthy people. (For instance, hiccups may be considered a type of myoclonus.) In severe cases, it can interfere with movement control and balance, and limit various everyday activities such as eating or talking. Myoclonus affects males and females in equal numbers. Some forms of myoclonus are common and some forms are rare. In general, the incidence of myoclonus is 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, and the prevalence is 8.6 cases per 100,000 populations.\n', 'Gottron syndrome (GS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the appearance of premature aging (progeria), especially in the form of unusually fragile, thin skin on the hands and feet (distal extremities).  GS is described as a mild, nonprogressive, congenital form of skin atrophy due to the loss of the fatty tissue directly under the skin (subcutaneous atrophy). Other findings may include abnormally small hands and feet with unusually prominent veins on the chest; small stature; and/or abnormally small jaw (micrognathia). From infancy on, children with Gottron syndrome appear older than their actual age.  The skin is unusually thin, taut, and parchment-like on the hands and feet (distal extremities).  The hands and feet remain abnormally small into adulthood.  The veins on the chest are very visible and prominent due to diminished amounts of fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat). It is believed that Gottron syndrome may affect more females than males.  Approximately forty cases have been reported in the medical literature. Treatment for Gottron syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families.\n', 'Wilson disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disease is found in all races and ethnic groups. Although estimates vary, it is believed that Wilson’s disease occurs in approximately one in 30,000 to 40,000 people worldwide. Approximately one in 90 people may be carriers of the disease gene. Although only about 2,000-3,000 cases have been diagnosed in the United States, other affected individuals may be misdiagnosed with other neurological, liver or psychiatric disorders. According to one estimate, there may actually be 9,000 people affected by Wilson’s disease in the United States.\n', 'Urachal cancer is a form of cancer that arises in a structure called the urachus. The urachus is a canal that exists when the fetus is developing before birth. This canal runs from the bladder of the fetus to the belly button (umbilicus). It drains the urinary bladder of the fetus. Between the fourth and fifth month of pregnancy, this canal breaks down (degenerates) into a fibrous band of tissue called a ligament. This ligament runs from the belly button to the top of the bladder and is called the median umbilical ligament. Sometimes, there are tissue remnants of the urachus in adults (about 1/3 of adults have urachal tissue remnants). This usually does not cause any problems. However, sometimes these remnants can potentially become cancerous (malignant). Urachal cancer will often extend into surrounding structures like the bladder, and can potentially spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. The exact, underlying cause of urachal cancer is not fully understood. Surgery is the most common treatment option. Urachal cancer is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence of this form of cancer in the general population is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Urachal cancer accounts for less than 1% of bladder cancers. Males and females are affected. Most people are in their 40-50s when diagnosed with the disorder.\n', 'PSP is under-diagnosed, so it is difficult to know how many people are affected. This disorder is believed to affect approximately 20,000 people in the United States. However, far fewer cases have been diagnosed. According to some reports, PSP is estimated to affect as many as 5 in 100,000 people. The onset of this disorder occurs between 45 and 75 years of age, with the average age of onset at about 63 years. Males are affected more often than females. The diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic physical findings.\n', '"Sakati syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as ""Acrocephalopolysyndactyly"" (ACPS). All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). In addition, Sakati syndrome, which is also known as ACPS type III, is associated with abnormalities of bones of the legs, structural heart malformations that are present at birth (congenital heart defects), and/or other findings. Sakati syndrome is thought to be caused by a new genetic change (mutation) that occurs randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). This mutation is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Sakati syndrome is named after the researcher (N. Sakati) who, along with colleagues, originally described the condition in 1971.  They reported the disease entity in a single male child of a couple who were of advanced parental age.  This apparently remains the only case reported in the medical literature to date. Sakati syndrome can be detected at birth, based upon a clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic physical findings."\n', '"Penta X Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects females. Females normally have two X chromosomes. However, in those with Penta X Syndrome, there are three additional (or a total of five) X chromosomes in the nuclei of body cells (pentasomy X). The condition is typically characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation, short stature, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or other physical abnormalities. Characteristic craniofacial malformations may include upslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a flat nasal bridge, malformed ears, a short neck with a low hairline, and/or other findings. Penta X Syndrome may also be characterized by abnormal deviation (clinodactyly) or permanent flexion (camptodactyly) of the ""pinkies"" or fifth fingers; heart and/or kidney defects; deficient development of the ovaries and uterus; and/or other physical findings. The disorder results from errors during the division of reproductive cells in one of the parents. Penta X Syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects only females.  Since the syndrome was originally described in 1963 (Kesaree N), over 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Some females with Penta X Syndrome were originally thought to be affected by Down Syndrome due to the presence of certain features sometimes associated with the latter disorder.  (For further information, please see the “Related Disorders” section of this report below.) Penta X Syndrome is diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination; detection of characteristic physical findings; and chromosomal analysis that confirms the presence of three extra X chromosomes in body cells. In some instances, the abnormality may be detected before birth (prenatally) based on chromosomal analysis following certain procedures, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). During amniocentesis, a sample of fluid that surrounds the developing fetus is removed and analyzed, while CVS involves the removal of tissue samples from a portion of the placenta."\n', 'Syringobulbia is a neurological disorder characterized by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord that extends to involve the brainstem (medulla). It usually occurs as a slit-like gap within the lower brainstem that may affect one or more of the cranial nerves, causing facial palsies of various kinds. In addition, sensory and motor nerve pathways may be affected by compression and/or interruption. This disorder is intimately associated with syringomyelia, in which the syrinx is limited to the spinal cord, and to the Chiari I malformation. The cause of Syringobulbia is unknown.  The disorder is usually present from birth. Syringobulbia can affect people of either sex.  It usually is apparent before 30 years of age.  In one study of a pediatric population, the average age of onset of symptoms was just under 15 years of age. The diagnosis of syringobulbia is made by means of neuroimaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n', 'Epidermal nevus syndromes (ENSs) are a group of rare complex disorders characterized by the presence of skin lesions known as epidermal nevi associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities, most often affecting the brain, eye and skeletal systems. Epidermal nevi are overgrowths of structures and tissue of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. The different types of epidermal nevi can vary in size, number, location, distribution and appearance. Neurological abnormalities that can be associated with ENSs can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). Skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs). Ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, clouding (opacity) of the cornea or partial absence of tissue of the iris or retina (colobomas). Endocrine abnormalities such as vitamin D-resistant rickets have been associated with Schimmelpenning syndrome. The specific symptoms and severity of ENSs can vary greatly from one person to another. Most ENSs occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). Epidermal nevi (including as an isolated finding) have been reported to occur in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births. The percentage of individuals with epidermal nevi who also have extra-cutaneous malformations is much lower but likewise unknown. The prevalence and incidence of individual ENSs is unknown. A diagnosis of an epidermal nevus syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history and a thorough clinical evaluation. In some cases, a small sample of affected skin may be taken for microscopic study (biopsy). Additional tests may be required to detect the presence and extent of associated symptoms. Such tests include a skeletal survey, chest x-rays and specialized imaging techniques to evaluate the brain. Such imaging techniques may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whether a child with an epidermal nevus should undergo such imaging techniques is controversial. Some researchers believe that these tests should be avoided unless there are clinical signs of central nervous involvement. In three of the well-defined ENSs (type 2 segmental Cowden disease, García-Hafner-Happle syndrome, CHILD syndrome), molecular testing is now possible.\n', 'Achondroplasia appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. This disorder begins in the developing fetus and is one of the most common forms of skeletal dysplasia that causes dwarfism. The estimated frequency of achondroplasia has ranged from about one in 15,000 to one in 35,000 births.\n', 'Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive, neurological disease characterized by tremor, most often of the hands or arms. A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, movement of a body part. Tremor may be seen as involuntary shaking or trembling of the affected area. In individuals with ET, other motor symptoms may be present including an unsteady manner of walking due to an inability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia). In some cases, affected individuals may also develop a variety of non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment, depression or anxiety. ET can occur in childhood or adulthood. The exact, underlying cause of ET is not fully understood. In some cases, the disorder runs in families; in others, it occurs in individuals with no previous family history. The causes of ET are most likely many, which means that several factors, such as genetic and environmental ones, may each play a role in the development of the disorder. ET is the most prevalent tremor disorder and is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. An estimated 7 million Americans have ET. The incidence of ET increases with age and more than 4% of the population over the age of 40 has ET. Although the disorder is most common in older adults, it can affect individuals of any age including middle-aged or young adults and children. In rare cases, it has been reported during infancy. Individuals with a family history of ET tend to experience earlier onset of tremor. ET affects both men and women and individuals of every race or ethnicity. A diagnosis of ET is based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. There is no specific test to diagnose ET. A neurological exam and other tests to evaluate the tremor may be conducted to rule out other causes of tremor.\n', 'The sideroblastic anemias are a group of blood disorders in which the body has enough iron but is unable to use it to make hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. As a result, iron accumulates in the mitochondria of red blood cells, giving a ringed appearance to the nucleus (ringed sideroblast). There are three categories of sideroblastic anemias: inherited, acquired, and idiopathic (of unknown origin). The signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include fatigue, breathing difficulties, and weakness. Enlargement of the liver or spleen may also occur. In severe cases, the increased levels of iron in the blood may lead to heart disease, liver damage, and kidney failure. Suspicion of an occurrence of sideroblastic anemia will generate blood studies including staining of the red blood cells to determine if the characteristic ringed sideroblasts are present in the mitochondria. Biochemical analyses may be conducted to determine the level of an enzyme essential to hemoglobin, delta-aminolevulinic synthetase.\n', 'Angelman syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of Angelman syndrome is estimated to be approximately 1 in 12,000-20,000 people in the general population. However, many cases may go undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the disorder’s prevalence in the general population.\n', 'Chromosome 13, Partial Monosomy 13q is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the long arm (q) of chromosome 13 is missing (deleted or monosomic). The range and severity of symptoms may vary greatly, depending upon the exact size and location of the deletion on 13q. Chromosome 13, Partial Monosomy 13q is usually apparent at birth and may be characterized by low birth weight, malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, abnormalities of the eyes, defects of the hands and/or feet, genital malformations in affected males, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Affected infants and children may also exhibit delays in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and muscular activity (psychomotor retardation) as well as varying degrees of intellectual disability. In the majority of cases, Chromosome 13, Partial Monosomy 13q appears to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadic). Chromosome 13, Partial Monosomy 13q appears to affect females slightly more frequently than males. Although rare, deletions involving chromosome 13q are among the most commonly observed monosomies. Since the disorder was originally reported in 1963, more than 125 cases have been recorded in the medical literature.\n', 'Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS) is a rare genetic disorder that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The syndrome is characterized by severe growth delays before birth (intrauterine growth retardation); low birth weight and length; and distinctive abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) region. These may include marked smallness of the head (microcephaly), sloping of the forehead, widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), and other malformations, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance. NLS is also typically characterized by abnormal accumulations of fluid in tissues throughout the body (generalized edema); permanent flexion and immobilization of multiple joints (flexion contractures); other limb malformations; and/or abnormalities of the brain, skin, genitals, kidneys, and/or heart. NLS appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in three siblings in 1971 (Neu, RL) as well as three siblings in another family in 1972 (Laxova, R), over 30 additional cases have been reported. Investigators suggest that the disorder may have a higher frequency in Pakistanis than in other geographic or ethnic populations.\n', "Wernicke syndrome and Korsakoff syndrome are related disorders that often occur due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Wernicke's syndrome, also known as Wernicke encephalopathy, is a neurological disease characterized by the clinical triad of confusion, the inability to coordinate voluntary movement (ataxia), and eye (ocular) abnormalities. Korsakoff's syndrome is a mental disorder characterized by disproportionate memory loss in relation to other mental aspects. When these two disorders occur together, the term Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is used. In the United States, most cases occur in alcoholics. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome occurs in 1-2 percent of the general population in the United States. The disorder affects slightly more males than females and is evenly distributed between ages 30-70.\n", "Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is typically evident at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and physical features that vary greatly in range and severity. In many affected individuals, associated abnormalities include a distinctive facial appearance; a broad or webbed neck; a low posterior hairline; a typical chest deformity and short stature. Characteristic features of the head and facial (craniofacial) area may include widely set eyes (ocular hypertelorism); skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis); a small jaw (micrognathia); a depressed nasal root; a short nose with broad base; and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears (pinnae). Distinctive skeletal malformations are also typically present, such as abnormalities of the breastbone (sternum), curvature of the spine (kyphosis and/or scoliosis), and outward deviation of the elbows (cubitus valgus). Many infants with Noonan syndrome also have heart (cardiac) defects, such as obstruction of proper blood flow from the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valvular stenosis) and thickening of the ventricular heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Additional abnormalities may include malformations of certain blood and lymph vessels, blood clotting and platelet deficiencies, learning difficulties or mild intellectual disability, failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism) by the first year of life in affected males, and/or other symptoms and findings. Noonan syndrome appears to affect more males than females and is thought to affect approximately one in 1,000 to one in 2,500 people. However, other reports indicate that the disorder may affect more than one in 1,000 newborns in the general population. Since Noonan syndrome was originally reported in 1883 (O. Kobylinski) and more thoroughly described in 1963 (J.A. Noonan and D.A. Ehmke), more than 500 patients shave been discussed in the medical literature. Because Noonan syndrome is extremely variable and therefore may be under- or misdiagnosed, it may be difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.\n", 'Cystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms of this disorder typically begin between 10 and 30 years of age, although elevated cystine excretion may be found in infancy. The disorder occurs in approximately 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the United States. The prevalence of cystinuria varies in different countries.\n', 'Signs and symptoms of EDS may become apparent during childhood. However, depending upon the form and severity, age of diagnosis varies widely. Reported estimates for the incidence of all EDS types range from 1/ 2,500 to 1/5,000 births. hEDS is estimated to affect 1/10,000-1/15,0000. cEDS is estimated to affect 1/20,000-1/40,0000. Because those with mild joint and skin manifestations may not seek medical attention they remain undiagnosed and it is difficult to determine the true frequency of EDS mutations in the general population. hEDS, clEDS, and vEDS are most common subtypes. Other subtypes (kEDS, aEDS, and dEDS) are much less common. Only about 60 individuals with kEDS have been identified. Only about 30 patients with aEDS have been reported. Only about 12 patients of dEDS have been described. Some named variants of EDS (e.g. X type or dysfibronectinemic type) have only been identified and reported in single individuals within one affected family.\n', 'Chromosome 3, Trisomy 3q2 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the 3rd chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Associated symptoms and findings may be variable, depending upon the specific length and location of the duplicated (trisomic) portion of chromosome 3. However, many affected infants and children have developmental delays, mental retardation, and characteristic abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance. Such craniofacial abnormalities may include a relatively short head (brachycephaly), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), upwardly slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and a small nose with upturned nostrils (anteverted nares). Affected infants and children also tend to have long eyelashes; arched, bushy, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys), an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and generalized excessive hair growth (hirsutism). Chromosome 3, Trisomy 3q2 may also be characterized by eye (ocular) abnormalities, limb defects, structural heart malformations (congenital heart defects), or other physical features. Chromosome 3, Trisomy 3q2 appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. At least 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  In some cases, the disorder may be suspected before birth (prenatally) based upon the results of specialized tests.  (For further information, please see the “Standard Therapies” section of this report below.)  The disorder is usually detected or confirmed at birth or during early infancy based upon characteristic symptoms and physical findings.\n', 'FSHD appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. The estimated prevalence is between four and ten per 100,000 people. There are a number of genetic neuromuscular diseases that may be characterized by muscle weakness of varying severity, muscle atrophy, and associated symptoms that may be similar to those that may occur with FSHD. These include myofibrillar myopathy, inclusion body myositis, including inclusion body myopathy 2 (IBM2), mitochondrial myopathies, congenital myopathies and polymyositis. These conditions typically have characteristic features that may differentiate them from FSHD. (For more information on such disorders, choose the exact disease name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', '"Congenital wandering spleen is a very rare, randomly distributed birth defect characterized by the absence or weakness of one or more of the ligaments that hold the spleen in its normal position in the upper left abdomen. The disorder is not genetic in origin. Instead of ligaments, the spleen is attached by a stalk-like tissue supplied with blood vessels (vascular pedicle). If the pedicle is twisted in the course of the movement of the spleen, the blood supply may be interrupted or blocked (ischemia) to the point of severe damage to the blood vessels (infarction). Because there is little or nothing to hold it in place the spleen ""wanders"" in the lower abdomen or pelvis where it may be mistaken for an unidentified abdominal mass. The diagnosis of wanderin. spleen is suspected when the pain associated with an abdominal mass can be relieved by moving it toward the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, the normal position of the spleen. Wandering spleen may be confirmed by specialized examinations such as ultrasonography and CT scan that enable the physician to view the structure, size, and placement of the spleen within the abdomen or pelvis. Specialized ultrasound tests (i.e., Doppler studies) may show impaired blood flow in and out of the spleen. Radioisotopic scanning (technetium 99 sulfur colloid scan), another imaging test, allows the physician to determine how well the liver and spleen are functioning. Low spleen function (functional asplenia) may suggest that the organ is damaged as a result of arterial obstruction (infarct)."\n', 'The exact cause of megalocornea intellectual disability syndrome is unknown. Megalocornea, when occurring as an isolated finding, is usually inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits the same abnormal gene for the same trait from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms. The risk for two carrier parents to both pass the defective gene and, therefore, have an affected child is 25 percent with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50 percent with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents and be genetically normal for that particular trait is 25 percent. The risk is the same for males and females. Approximately 37 individuals with megalocornea intellectual disability syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. More males have been reported than females. The disorder is present at birth (congenital). The syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1975.\n', "Cold antibody hemolytic anemia (CAHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (rbcs) by the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (antibodies). Normally, the red blood cells have a life span of approximately 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen. In individuals with CAHA, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. The severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production. Although cold antibody hemolytic anemia is known to be an autoimmune disorder, neither its exact underlying cause nor the process by which the disorder becomes apparent is fully understood.  Autoimmune disorders occur when the body’s natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects older people.  The incidence of CAHA in the general population is about 1 in 80,000.  There appears to be a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of CAHA, with a male to female ratio of 2 to 3.  Those individuals with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this disorder. In order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from the other anemias, doctors examine the patient's blood to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells, since the number of young cells is increased in hemolytic anemia. The patient is also examined to check for spleen or liver enlargement. An antiglobulin test (Coomb's reaction) may be performed as the initial screening exam to detect the presence of immunoglobulin or complement on the red-cell membrane and to determine the specific class of immunoglobulin or complement present. In the case of cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the Coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n", 'Pontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) are a group of rare heterogeneous conditions characterized by prenatal development of an abnormally small cerebellum and brain stem, which is usually associated with profound psychomotor retardation. Although the clinical features vary widely, pontocerebellar hypoplasias are usually associated with profound intellectual disability and delayed or absent psychomotor milestones. In most cases, the disease is uniformly fatal early in life. Life span has ranged from death in the perinatal period to about 20-25 years of age. Only a few individuals-usually patients with PCH type 2-have survived to the second and third decades of life. At least 6 types of PCH have been described and a few rare variants are now being identified. The disease affects both males and females without a predilection for either sex. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown.\n', 'In the general population, MCADD occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 individuals. The prevalence of MCADD in people of northern European descent has been estimated to be in the range of 1 in 6,400 to 1 in 46,000 individuals. Gypsies of Portugal and Native Americans of California also have a higher than average prevalence.\n', 'DNMT1 HSAN1E affects both genders equally. Due to the complexity of disease and relatively lack of awareness of this disease, HSAN1E is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to assess its prevalence and incidence in the population.\n', '"Wildervanck syndrome, also known as cervicooculoacoustic syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects females. The disorder is characterized by a skeletal condition known as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS); abnormalities of certain eye (ocular) movements (i.e., Duane syndrome); and/or hearing impairment that is present at birth (congenital). In individuals with KFS, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). Duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or ""drawing back"" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus). In some affected individuals, additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In most cases, Wildervanck syndrome appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). As mentioned above, Wildervanck syndrome primarily affects females. Since the disorder was originally described in 1952 (L.S. Wildervanck), almost 90 cases have been reported in the medical literature. According to some reports, approximately one percent of females with hearing impairment may be affected by Wildervanck syndrome. Wildervanck syndrome may be detected at birth or during the first year of life based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized tests. Diagnostic studies may include advanced imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of internal structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to form detailed cross-sectional images of certain organs and tissues. Such techniques may help to detect and characterize abnormalities of the inner ear, union or fusion of certain bones of the spinal column (e.g., cervical vertebrae), possible impingement of vertebrae on the spinal cord, or other abnormalities potentially associated with the disorder. In addition, in some individuals with Wildervanck syndrome, exploratory surgery may be conducted to detect malformations of the middle ear (exploratory tympanotomy). Additional specialized tests may also be performed to confirm or characterize other abnormalities that may be associated with the disorder (e.g., certain ocular findings, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities, etc.)."\n', 'Shwachman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with multiple and varied manifestations. The disorder is typically characterized by signs of insufficient absorption (malabsorption) of fats and other nutrients due to abnormal development of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency) and improper functioning of the bone marrow (bone marrow dysfunction), resulting in low levels of circulating blood cells (hematologic abnormalities). Additional characteristic findings may include short stature; abnormal bone development affecting the rib cage and/or bones in the arms and/or legs (metaphyseal dysostosis); and/or liver abnormalities.\n', 'Maffucci syndrome occurs in all ethnic groups and equally affects both sexes. The diagnosis of Maffucci syndrome is made by a detailed history, thorough physical examination and radiologic assessment. Surgical removal and microscopic study of the skeletal lesions confirm the presence of enchondroma and distinguish the tumor from chondrosarcoma.\n', 'SGS affects males and females in equal numbers and occurs worldwide with no ethnic predisposition. There are currently approximately 40 known patients in the general population. Because of the similar symptoms, SGS is often misdiagnosed as Loeys-Dietz or Marfan syndrome. The disorder is probably underdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency.\n', '"Follicular lymphoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which is a group of related cancers that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). The lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) and other foreign bodies. Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including, but not limited to, the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymphocytes are stored within lymph nodes and may also be found in other lymphatic tissues. In addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Lymphatic tissue or circulating lymphocytes may also be located in other regions of the body. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes (B-cells), which may produce specific antibodies to ""neutralize"" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes (T-cells), which may directly destroy microorganisms or cancer cells, or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. Follicular lymphoma affects both men and women, but is slightly more common in women. This form of cancer is found all over the world and can affect people of all races. It is less common in individuals of Asian or African heritage than it is in other ethnicities. The mean age at diagnosis is 65. In the United States and Western Europe, follicular lymphoma is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for about 30%-35% of people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and almost 75% of people with indolent forms of lymphoma. Each year, 15-20,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Pediatric follicular lymphoma is extremely rare variant that makes up only 1-2% of all malignant lymphomas in children. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as a group, accounts for about 4.3% of people with cancer in the United States."\n', 'Subacute cerebellar degeneration (SCD) is characterized by the deterioration of the area of the brain concerned with muscle coordination and balance (the cerebellum). Less frequently, the area involved may include the area connecting the spinal cord to the brain (the medulla oblongata, the cerebral cortex, and the brain stem). There are two types of subacute cerebellar degeneration: paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, which sometimes precedes the diagnosis of cancer, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration, caused by a lack of the vitamin B-1 (thiamine). These two types share symptoms but not the same cause. In paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, the average age of onset is 50, with males affected more often than females.  This form of cerebellar degeneration may precede cancer.  Alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration affects alcoholics and people with thiamine deficiency.  It is not related to cancer and is more common than the paraneoplastic type. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may improve after successful treatment of the underlying cancer. For alcoholic/nutritional cerebellar degeneration, thiamine is given along with other B vitamins, usually relieving the condition if the patient stops drinking alcohol and resumes a normal diet.\n', 'Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder that affects infants and children. It is characterized by a thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue (inelastic collagen) and elastic fibers. The normal heart has four chambers. Two chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum. The other two chambers, known as ventricles, are also separated by a septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Fewer than 1 percent of infants and children with congenital heart disease are diagnosed with this disorder.  A 1964 study suggested an incidence of 1 in 5,000 live births.  However, in the United States there has been a marked reduction in incidence since then for reasons that are not known.  The disorder is extremely rare. The diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis is confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a physical examination that may reveal signs of respiratory distress (i.e., moist rales) and galloping heart rhythms. Radiographic studies (x-ray) of the chest typically reveal abnormal enlargement of the heart, especially the left ventricle (ventricular hypertrophy). Damage to the heart may be demonstrated by measuring the electrical activity of the heart (i.e., electrocardiogram [EKG]). This test may show subtle changes (i.e., S-T segment and T-wave changes) that strongly suggest damage to the heart that is characteristic of EFE. Repeated electrocardiograms may be required to monitor changes in heart function.\n', '"Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that belongs to a group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, and/or skin. Setleis syndrome is characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the facial area that may be apparent at birth (congenital). Most affected infants have multiple, scar-like, circular depressions on both temples (bitemporal). These marks closely resemble those made when forceps are used to assist delivery. In addition, affected infants may have puffy, wrinkled skin around the eyes (periorbital) and/or abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. Infants with Setleis syndrome may be missing eyelashes on both the upper and lower lids, or they may have multiple rows of lashes on the upper lids but none on the lower lids. In addition, in some cases, the bridge of the nose may appear flat, while the tip may appear unusually rounded (bulbous). Affected infants often have loose, excessive (redundant) skin, particularly in the area of the nose and the chin. Due to such facial abnormalities, infants with Setleis syndrome may have an aged and/or ""leonine"" (lion-like) appearance. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Most cases of Setleis syndrome are thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The majority of these cases have occurred in individuals from Puerto Rico. Setleis syndrome is usually diagnosed shortly after birth based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic features, such as distinctive scar-like, circular depressions on both temples; an aged and/or ""leonine"" facial appearance; and characteristic abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. It is possible that microscopic examination of small samples of skin tissue (biopsy) from the temples may reveal abnormal thinning of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) and absence of certain specialized structures normally located within the inner layer of the skin (e.g., sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles)."\n', 'NF2 is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. All races and ethnic groups are equally affected by this disorder. The estimated incidence of NF2 is 1 in 33,000 people worldwide. The symptoms of this disease typically become apparent during puberty or early adulthood. The average age of onset is 18 to 24 years.\n', 'Patients may have no symptoms, particularly when the cancer is at an early stage. Occasionally biliary tract cancers are diagnosed incidentally when a CT or MRI scan is done for another reason, or when the gallbladder is removed due to symptomatic gallstones. Patients may have non-specific symptoms including weight loss, abdominal pain, fevers, night sweats and fatigue. Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or gallbladder cancers more frequently cause patients to develop jaundice due to tumor or lymph nodes blocking a major bile duct [4]. Most cases of biliary tract cancer are sporadic, with no identifiable predisposing patient factors. There are several known risk factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma however, including liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, biliary tract stones, liver fluke infections, a congenital anatomical abnormality called a choledochal cyst and the chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts also called primary sclerosing cholangitis. Exposure to some industrial chemicals such as nitrosamines, dioxin, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls are also thought to increase an individual’s risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.  In the USA, gallbladder cancer is commonly associated with the presence of long standing gallstones resulting in calcification of the gallbladder wall or “porcelain gallbladder”.  Gallbladder polyps are also associated with increased risk of gallbladder cancer. The incidence of bile duct cancers differs worldwide, likely reflecting both differing genetic predisposition and variable exposure to known risk factors[5]. Approximately 12,000 new affected individuals of bile duct cancers are diagnosed in the USA each year, of which over 9,000 are gallbladder cancers and distal/perihilar cholangiocarcinomas and 3,000 are intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [6]. The overall incidence of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is 1 person per 100,000 per year. The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is approximately 0.7 per 100,000. During the last 30 years, it appears that the incidence of biliary tract cancers in the United States is increasing [7]. This increase may be due in part to increased recognition of the diagnosis of biliary cancer, cases which may previously have been classified as cancer of unknown origin. Gallbladder cancer is more common in women than in men, and in some countries the rates are three times higher for women. Certain geographic areas are characterized by a high incidence of gallbladder cancer, including Chile, Bolivia and India. A high incidence also has been documented in North American Native Americans and Mexican Americans [7]. A diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer is made based on identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, clinical examination and several specialized tests including blood test, imaging tests and endoscopic procedures. Either CT or MRI scans may be used to assess the tumor size and to look for blockage of the bile ducts and sites of spread [9, 10]. ERCP may be used to insert a stent into a blocked bile duct to relieve jaundice. A biopsy is usually required to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and may be obtained by a CT or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy [11]. Some patients with gallbladder cancer are incidentally diagnosed following elective removal of their gallbladder due to gallstones, where the cancer is only detected on pathologic examination.\n', 'Eosinophilic gastroenteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. Symptoms include dysphagia (sometimes presenting as food impaction), heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating (ascites is possible). The eosinophilic infiltration may involve one or more layers of the gastrointestinal wall. The particular symptoms present in each person depend upon the layer and the location of involvement. Most commonly, the stomach wall and the small bowel are involved. Mucosal involvement leads to protein-losing enteropathy and malabsorption. Muscle layer involvement causes abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspeptic symptoms and bowel obstruction. Subserosal involvement predominantly causes ascites with marked eosinophilia. Sometimes eosinophilic pleural effusion is present. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a chronic, waxing and waning condition. The exact cause of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is unknown. Some cases of this disease may be caused by a hypersensitivity to certain foods or other unknown allergens. Often, a family history of allergy is present. Atopy (asthma, hay fever or eczema) is present in a subset of patients. Food allergies are common. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease (10/100.000) that affects both males and females, but is slightly more common among men. Peak prevalence is in children and adults 20-50 years of age. The reported prevalence has increased markedly, and this is probably due to prior under-diagnosis. People with a history of allergies, eczema, and seasonal asthma are more likely to develop this disease. Some patients present with elevated IgE and eosinophilia of tissue and blood. A careful history may suggest to the physician that a biopsy is required. The results of the biopsy (endoscopic or full-thickness surgical biopsy) are usually diagnostic.\n', 'Women are at a higher risk of developing Tarlov cysts than men. The exact incidence or prevalence of symptomatic Tarlov cysts in the general population is unknown. Because these cysts often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult. However, the total number of Tarlov cyst patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) is estimated at 4.6 to 9 percent of the adult population.\n', 'Papular urticaria, usually called hives, is characterized by large numbers of very itchy red bumps (papules) that come and go every few days over a period of a month or so. The bumps are usually between 0.2 and 2 cm. in size and some may develop into fluid-filled blisters (bullae). This condition is usually triggered by allergic reactions to insect bites, sensitivity to drugs, or other environmental causes. In some cases, swelling of the soft tissues of the face, neck, and hands (angioedema) may also occur. Acute papular urticaria and angioedema are essentially exaggerated allergic reactions limited to the skin and tissues just under the skin (subcutaneous tissues).  The reaction may be caused by a drug allergy, by insect stings or bites, by desensitization injections (allergy shots) or ingestion of certain foods (particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts or fruits) by people who are allergic to these substances.  In some cases (such as reactions to strawberries), the reaction may occur only after overindulgence, and possibly result from direct toxic histamine release into the blood.  If acute angioedema is recurrent, progressive, and never associated with urticaria, a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be suspected. Children from 2 to 7 years are most commonly, but not exclusively, affected by papular urticaria. Children are especially susceptible in the summertime when the insect population increases.  It is more rare in adults, perhaps in part because adults build up a tolerance.\n', '"Mosaic trisomy 9 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the entire 9th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body. The term ""mosaic"" indicates that some cells contain the extra chromosome 9, while others have the typical chromosomal pair. Mosaic Trisomy 9 may be caused by errors during the division of a parent\'s egg or sperm or during the division of body tissue cells (somatic cells) early in the development of the fetus. Mosaic trisomy 9 appears to affect males and females of all ethnicities in relatively equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in 1973 (Haslam RH), over 55 cases have been reported in the medical literature."\n', 'ADCY5-related dyskinesia affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. Rare disorders like ADCY5-dyskinesia often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. The disorder is almost certainly underrecognized and underdiagnosed.\n', 'Idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (IDPA) is a rare congenital defect characterized by a wider than normal main pulmonary artery in the absence of any apparent anatomical or physiological cause. Idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery commonly does not produce symptoms because there is no circulatory abnormality.  Clinical signs are minimal, and usually consist of a palpable pulmonary ejection sound that disappears when the patient inhales, a soft pulmonary ejection systolic murmur (abnormal heart sound), and splitting of the second sound on breathing in.  IDPA does not cause pulmonary valve disease, nor does bacterial endocarditis occur in patients with this condition.  The electrocardiogram is normal, and diagnosis is made when chest X-rays reveal a dilated pulmonary artery without cardiac chamber enlargement. The cause of idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery is unknown.  A defect in the normal development of pulmonary artery elastic tissue before or after birth has been postulated.  The dilatation may also be a consequence of a generalized connective tissue disease as it is occasionally found in Marfan’s syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  (For more information on these disorders, choose “Marfan” and Ehlers-Danlos” as your search terms in the Rare Disease Database. The incidence and prevalence of IDPA are not known.  Because the disorder is benign in most instances, neither clinicians nor epidemiologists are able to measure the distribution of the disease with confidence. Treatment for idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery is not required. People with this condition have a normal life expectancy, provided they have no cardiac lesions.\n', "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of rare inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency of one of the enzymes needed to make specific hormones. CAH effects the adrenal glands located at the top of each kidney. Normally, the adrenal glands are responsible for producing three different hormones: 1. corticosteroids, which gauge the body's response to illness or injury; 2. mineralocorticoids, which regulate salt and water levels; and 3. androgens, which are male sex hormones. An enzyme deficiency will make the body unable to produce one or more of these hormones, which in turn will result in the overproduction of another type of hormone precursor in order to compensate for the loss. The most common form of CAH, 21 hydroxylase deficiency, affects approximately 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the United States and Europe. Among the Yupik Eskimos, the occurrence of the salt-wasting form of this disorder may be as high as 1 in 282 individuals. Other forms of CAH are much rarer. In contrast, non-classical CAH affects approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 individuals in the general population.\n", 'At this time, clinicians believe that an as yet unknown immunological process is the preferred explanation for the cause of most cases of endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler’s disease. In the past, the cause of both conditions was attributed to the presence of the filaria worm in patients or to poor nutrition. Widespread infection with such worms and poor diets are typical in the tropical regions in which these disorders are more common. Eosinophils have been observed in some cases of endomyocardial fibrosis, suggesting a form of hypersensitivity may play a role in select cases. In children, endomyocardial fibrosis has been associated with the mumps virus. Endomyocardial fibrosis is principally an endemic disease of the equatorial tropics. It is exceedingly rare in Europe and North America. It affects all races, mostly children and young adults. The disease has been described in a few patients over 60 years of age and, rarely, in patients younger than 5 years of age. Echocardiography is the primary tool used to diagnose suspected cases of endomyocardial fibrosis or Loeffler’s disease. A heart muscle biopsy is sometimes obtained to confirm the diagnosis.\n', 'Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is a rare eye disorder of unknown (idiopathic) cause. The disorder is characterized by the impairment of central vision in one eye (unilateral) but, within a few days, the second eye may also become affected (bilateral). In most cases, the disorder resolves within a few weeks without loss of clearness of vision (acuity). However, in some cases, visual acuity does not improve. This disorder occurs predominantly in young adults, with a mean age of onset of 27 years. It is reported that, in approximately one-third of the cases, an influenza-like illness preceded the development of the disorder. The exact cause of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is not known.  Researchers suspect that it may be caused by a virus. It can subside without treatment or it may recur at any time. The viruses may stay dormant in humans for extended periods of time, then for reasons yet unknown may unexplainably become reactivated. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is a rare visual disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Treatment of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is symptomatic and supportive. Very often vision returns without specific treatment.\n', 'AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG52 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizure, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.\n', 'Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is a rare skin disease affecting children between the ages of nine months and nine years. Major symptoms may include blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks and arms. The disorder is usually preceded by a viral infection. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is characterized by blisters on the skin that may or may not itch.  They are usually found on the face, buttocks, arms or legs. The blisters consist of large, flat-topped, fluid filled sacks.  They usually occur along with upper respiratory tract infection.  The blisters usually last from twenty to twenty-five days; they do not usually recur.  There may be an enlargement of the lymph nodes in the trunk area of the body. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome usually occurs after a bout with a viral disease such as:  Coxsackievirus, Hepatitis-B, Infectious Mononucleosis or Cytomegalovirus, or after vaccination with a live virus serum. The cause of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is thought to be a reaction to a previous viral infection.  In many countries the predisposing cause is usually the Hepatitis-B virus.  In North America other viruses are more often the predisposing cause.  The exact reasons for this cause and effect situation are unknown. Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome usually affects children between the ages of nine months and nine years of age.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. Although the disorder is regularly associated with Hepatitis-B infections in other countries, in North America it is rarely the cause. Because Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome is a self-limiting disorder, the treatment of affected children is primarily symptomatic and supportive. For example, in some cases, the use of topical ointments or certain medications by mouth may be recommended to help alleviate mild to potentially severe itching (pruritus). The skin lesions associated with Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome typically spontaneously resolve within approximately 15 to 60 days. When associated findings include enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) and/or enlargement of the liver (i.e., in association with liver inflammation [hepatitis]), such findings may persist for several months after initial symptom onset.\n', 'Chromosome 6 Ring is a rare disorder in which there is loss (deletion) of chromosomal material from both ends of the 6th chromosome and joining of the ends to form a ring.  Associated symptoms and findings may vary greatly, depending upon the amount and location of lost chromosomal material and other factors. For example, there have been some reported cases in which children with Chromosome 6 Ring have few physical abnormalities and normal intelligence. However, many with the chromosomal abnormality are affected by growth retardation; varying degrees of mental retardation; mild to severe delays in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and physical activities (psychomotor retardation); and/or various abnormalities of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial features often include an unusually small head (microcephaly), malformed or low-set ears, and/or a small jaw (micrognathia). Eye (ocular) defects are also relatively common, such as drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis), unusually small eyes (microphthalmia), abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus), and/or other findings. Chromosome 6 Ring usually appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in the development of the embryo that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). Since Chromosome 6 Ring was originally described, approximately 23 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  In observed cases, males appear to be affected slightly more frequently than females.\n', 'Hereditary lymphedema affects females more often than males. The estimated prevalence of these disorders is 1 in 6,000 individuals within the general population. Hereditary lymphedema type II (Meige syndrome) is the most common form accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. The prevalence of hereditary lymphedema type I (Milroy disease) is unknown. Approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of hereditary lymphedema may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized imaging tests including lymphoscintigraphy, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During lymphoscintigraphy, a radioactively labeled colloid substance is injected intradermally into either the hands or feet. The time required for the tracer to be transported from the point of injection to the regional lymph nodes is recorded. In congenital lymphedema, the tracer may move\xa0sluggishly or not move from the site of injection. During an ultrasound, reflected sound waves create an image of the developing fetus. An ultrasound is used to rule out other conditions. A Doppler ultrasound can evaluate venous conditions such as varicose veins and venous blood clots. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. An MRI is used to detect findings characteristic of hereditary lymphedema including swelling (edema), a mass surrounded by a sac containing lymph fluid (lymphocele), and the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis).\n', 'Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. The disorder can occur in three different forms: adult, infantile, and neonatal. This inflammation may be caused by different types of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or malignant tumors. Chemical reactions to certain injections into the spinal canal can also cause Meningitis. This inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Adult forms of Meningitis are characterized by fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. Treatment with antibiotics is usually effective against the infection.\n', 'Histidinemia is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Based upon newborn screening of more than 20 million infants in several countries, histidinemia is estimated to occur in about one in 11,500 births overall. The disorder appears to be most prevalent among people of French Canadian or Japanese descent. Based upon newborn screening reports, approximately one in 8,600 infants in Quebec and one in 9,500 infants in Japan are affected by the disorder. The abnormality begins at birth and affects males and females in equal numbers. Histidinemia is now thought to be a primarily benign disorder. In some states in the United States (e.g., New York and Massachusetts) routine screening of newborns for histidinemia was conducted through blood or urine tests. However, newborn screening for histidinemia has been discontinued. A diagnosis of histidinemia may be made based upon increased levels of histidine in the blood or urine.\n', 'The specific underlying cause of vasculitis is not fully understood. However, in most cases, vasculitis is thought to be due to disturbances of the body’s immune system. Some forms of vasculitis may be due to allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to certain medications such as sulfur drugs, penicillin, propylthiouracil, other drugs, toxins, or other inhaled environmental irritants. Other forms may occur due to fungal, parasitic, or viral infections. In some instances, it is thought that vasculitis may be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Because of the wide range of symptoms and body systems involved, an extensive history and physical exam is needed before a clear diagnosis of the type of vasculitis can be made. In some cases, an x-ray of the blood vessels using dye (angiogram), or a biopsy of the affected organ may be recommended to give an accurate diagnosis and to insure proper treatment.\n', 'Marcus Gunn phenomenon is a rare genetic disorder that is usually present at birth. It is characterized by the movement of one upper eyelid in a rapid rising motion each time the jaw moves. Other eye abnormalities and vision difficulties may also occur. The exact cause of this phenomenon is not known. Marcus Gunn phenomenon is a rare genetic disorder present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers.  Approximately 300 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis is obvious and is often made by one or both of the parents who become aware of the major symptom during feeding.\n', 'ACTH deficiency arises as a result of decreased or absent production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. A decline in the concentration of ACTH in the blood leads to a reduction in the secretion of adrenal hormones, resulting in adrenal insufficiency (hypoadrenalism). Adrenal insufficiency leads to weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure (hypotension). Because these symptoms are so general, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed or missed entirely. For that reason, some clinicians believe the disorder to be more common than previously thought. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency most often occur in adults, but the disorder may also be diagnosed in infancy. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. When ACTH deficiency is suspected, blood samples are taken for analysis, especially of the level of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is the name of one of the hormones produced by the outer portion (cortex) of the adrenal glands. If the concentration of cortisol is low, it typically indicates a low concentration of ACTH. On occasion, an ACTH stimulation test may be administered.\n', 'Three M syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 25 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was first described in 1972.\n', 'Hypochrondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by small stature and disproportionately short arms, legs, hands, and feet (short-limbed dwarfism). Short stature often is not recognized until early to mid childhood or, in some cases, as late as adulthood. In those with the disorder, bowing of the legs typically develops during early childhood but often improves spontaneously with age. Some affected individuals may also have an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), a relatively prominent forehead, and/or other physical abnormalities associated with the disorder. In addition, in about 10 percent of cases, mild mental retardation may be present. Hypochondroplasia appears to affect females and males in relatively equal numbers.  The features of the disorder were originally reported in 1913; hypochondroplasia was described as a distinct disease entity in 1924.  Over 100 cases have since been recorded in the medical literature, including isolated (sporadic) and familial cases.  Hypochondroplasia is thought to have an incidence of approximately one-twelfth that of achondroplasia.  (Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a particular disorder or condition during a specific period.)  The estimated frequency of achondroplasia has ranged from about one in 15,000 to one in 35,000 births.  (For further information on achondroplasia, please see the “Related Disorders” section of this report below.) As noted previously, in individuals with hypochondroplasia, short stature often may not be recognized until early or mid childhood or as late as adulthood. The disorder may be diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination; identification of characteristic physical findings (e.g., short stature, brachydactyly, genu varum, macrocephaly); x-ray studies; and/or other diagnostic techniques.\n', 'Glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). It is in the group of disorders known as cerebral organic acidemias. Individuals with this condition have deficiency or absence of GCDH enzyme that is involved in the lysine metabolism. GCDH deficiency results in increased concentrations of potentially neurotoxic metabolites, glutaric acid (GA), 3-hydroxy glutaric acid (3-OH-GA) and glutaconic acid within body tissues, especially within the brain. Two arbitrary biochemical subtypes have been defined, high (HE) and low excretors (LE), depending on the amount of GA in the urine. Newborns may show unspecific clinical signs like enlarged head circumference (macrocephaly) or decreased muscle tone (hypotonia).  Without treatment, most affected children develop an acute encephalopathic crisis following febrile illness episodes or other catabolic conditions resulting in bilateral striatal injury and consequently, dystonic movement disorder. Cognitive outcome has not been systematically studied, but severe cognitive dysfunction is rarely seen. Sometimes babies with GA1 have been mistaken to have been abused because they present with subdural and/or retinal hemorrhages. GA1 is included in the newborn screening panel in a growing number of countries which is essential for early intervention.  Importantly, patients with the low excreting phenotype may be missed by newborn screening. GA1 is a rare inborn error of metabolism that affects males as often as females. It has been estimated that there are about 140 patients with this type of organic aciduria in the United States. GA1 occurs in approximately 1 of every 100,000 births. Five genetic isolates are known with a high carrier frequency (up to 1:10) and incidence (up to 1:250 newborns): the Old Order Amish Community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States, the Oji-Cree First Nations in Manitoba and Western Ontario, Canada, the Irish Travelers in the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom, the Lumbee in North Carolina, United States and the Xhosa in South Africa.\n', 'Erythrokeratodermia with ataxia (EKDA) is a hereditary disorder of the skin and nervous system (neurocutaneous syndrome) characterized by groups of hard, red plaques that develop during infancy and childhood. When these skin lesions heal, the disorder seems to become dormant for several years, after which the neurological symptoms and signs emerge in the form of a typically awkward gait (ataxia) when the affected individual is around 40 years of age or older. Erythrokeratodermia with ataxia starts during early infancy.  This disorder is characterized by groups of red, hardened scaly skin plaques (ichthyosis) that remain throughout childhood, but disappear during young adulthood.  These plaques tend to develop most often on the skin of the extremities.  They usually disappear during the summer.  A progressive neurologic syndrome develops during adulthood, consisting of impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), imperfect articulation of speech (dysarthria), involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes (nystagmus), and decreased tendon reflexes. Erythrokeratodermia with ataxia is an extremely rare disorder that is thought to affect males and females in equal numbers. The diagnosis of erythrokeratodermia with ataxia may be suspected soon after birth by the appearance of characteristic skin lesions. Neurological abnormalities associated with this disorder may not occur until adulthood.\n', 'Marden-Walker syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Patients with this disorder typically have a distinct facial expression, a cleft or high-arched palate, small or receding jaw (micrognathia), bone joints in a fixed position, growth delay and limited control of muscle movement. Marden-Walker syndrome affects males more often than females. Marden-Walker Syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males more often than females with a ratio of 11 to 3.  There have been approximately twenty cases reported in the medical literature. Genetic counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.\n', 'Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma was first described in the medical literature in 1959. It is an extremely rare form of cancer; fewer than 800 cancers have been reported in the medical literature. This tumor is most common in children and young adults (aged 10-30), but can affect individuals of any age including young children and older adults. Females are affected slightly more often than males. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is more likely to occur outside the bone in young adults or children and to affect bone in older adults. Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of chondrosarcoma.\n', 'Lymphedema-distichiasis affects males and females in equal numbers. Lymphedema develops in males at an earlier age than females. The prevalence of this disorder in the general population is unknown. Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome may go undiagnosed making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Desmoid tumors constitute 0.03% of all tumors. The estimated incidence in the general population is 2-4 per million people per year. Desmoid tumors are observed to be more common in persons aged 10-40 years but can occur in other age groups. Desmoid tumors can commonly occur in women after childbirth. The female:male gender ratio is 2:1. In children, the gender incidence is the same. The conclusive diagnosis of desmoid tumor requires a biopsy. Microscopic examination of the biopsy tissue confirms the diagnosis. On microscopic examination, the spindle cells of desmoid tumors appear to be myofibroblasts and are thought to be an abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts, which normally gradually disappear during the later stages of wound healing. Additionally, immunohistochemical stains can establish the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, a protein that is caused by the genetic mutations usually found in desmoid tumors. Nuclear reactivity shows relatively high specificity, detected in up to 90% of desmoids, regardless of site. Finally, antibodies are often examined in desmoid tumors, including smooth muscle actin, desmin and KIT, to aid in distinguishing them from other tumors.\n', 'Spastic paraplegia 50 (SPG50) is a slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorder that generally presents with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, small head size (microcephaly), seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. Hypotonia (low-muscle tone) develops into hypertonia (high-muscle tone), resulting in spasticity of the legs that leads to non-ambulation and wheelchair reliance. Spasticity may progress to the upper extremities, leading to the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso (tetraplegia). AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG50 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.\n', 'PHACE syndrome affects more females than it does males, although researchers are not exactly sure why this is the case. It has been described affecting many different ethnic groups. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 4 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Associated symptoms and physical findings may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. Such variability may depend upon the specific length and location of the duplicated (trisomic) portion of chromosome 4p as well as other factors. However, many affected infants may have feeding and breathing difficulties, characteristic malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, and abnormalities of the hands and feet. Additional features may include other skeletal defects, genital abnormalities in affected males, or heart (cardiac) defects. Trisomy 4p is also characterized by severe mental retardation. Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Trisomy for the short arm of chromosome 4 was originally described in 1970 (Wilson MG) and delineated as a distinct clinical syndrome in 1977 (Gonzalez CH).  More than 85 patients with the syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Many chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those associated with Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n', 'Rasmussen encephalitis, sometimes referred to as Rasmussen syndrome, is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by chronic progressive inflammation (encephalitis) of one cerebral hemisphere. As a result, the patient usually experiences frequent episodes of uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that cause epileptic seizures (epilepsy), and progressive cerebral destruction. With time, further symptoms may include progressive weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), language problems (if on the left side of the brain) and intellectual disabilities. The exact cause of this disorder is not known. The two leading ideas are that the brain inflammation might be a reaction of a foreign antigen (infection) or an autoimmune disease limited to one side of the brain resulting in brain damage. It occurs mostly, but not always, in children between the ages of two and ten years, and in many patients the course of the disease is most severe during the first 8 to 12 months. After the peak inflammatory response is reached, the progression of this disorder appears to slow or stop and the patient is left with permanent neurological deficits. Rasmussen encephalitis mostly affects children ten years of age and younger. It is unusual to affect children under two years of age. Adolescents and young adults in much smaller proportions are also affected. There may be a history of some prior mild cold or flu prior to the onset of the seizures. The annual number of new-onset Rasmussen has been estimated as 2.4/10,000,000 persons less than or equal to 18 years of age.\n', 'PLAN is an extremely rare genetic disorder, and the incidence and prevalence are not known with any certainty. It is estimated to occur in about 1-2/million children.\n', 'Megaloblastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces unusually large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). Bone marrow, the soft spongy material found inside certain bones, produces the main blood cells of the body -red cells, white cells, and platelets. Anemia is a condition characterized by the low levels of circulating, red blood cells. Red blood cells are released from the marrow into the bloodstream where they travel throughout the body delivering oxygen to tissue. A deficiency in healthy, fully-matured red blood cells can result in fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness and additional findings. Megaloblastic anemia has several different causes - deficiencies of either cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate (vitamin B9) are the two most common causes. These vitamins play an essential role in the production of red blood cells. Megaloblastic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. It can occur in individuals of any racial or ethnic background. Because the causes of megaloblastic anemia vary and because some individuals may not exhibit any obvious symptoms (asymptomatic), determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. A diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of blood tests. Blood tests may reveal the abnormally large, misshapen red blood cells that characterize megaloblastic anemia. Blood tests can also confirm cobalamin or folate deficiency as the cause of megaloblastic anemia. Additional tests such as a Schilling test, which confirms poor absorption as the cause of cobalamin deficiency, may be necessary.\n', '"Pertussis is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. This disease has 3 stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The symptoms of the catarrhal stage are mild and may go unnoticed. The paroxysmal stage of Pertussis is characterized by episodes of coughing with a distinctive ""whooping"" sound when breathing in (inspiration). This characteristic cough gives the disease its common name, Whooping Cough. During the convalescent stage, episodes of coughing are less frequent and symptoms improve. The incidence of Pertussis has diminished greatly with widespread use of the DPT vaccine (Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus), but in certain areas of the United States outbreaks have occurred periodically in recent years. Pertussis is an infectious disease caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus, Bordetella pertussis.  Pertussis is a highly contagious disease via droplets in the air from the respiratory tract of infected individuals.  Transmission occurs during the catarrhal stage and during the first 2 to 3 weeks of the paroxysmal phase. The diagnosis of Pertussis may be confirmed by isolating the organism Bordetella pertussis from the sputum of an affected individual. These sputum samples are best obtained using a cotton swab that is placed through the nose into the rear portion of the throat (posterior pharynx). The paroxysmal phase of Pertussis is associated with very high levels of white cells in the blood (i.e., lymphocytosis)."\n', 'AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4 Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG51 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizure, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.\n', '"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively rare form of cancer that most commonly develops in the salivary glands or other regions of the head and neck. ACC can occur in other parts of the body, such as the breast, skin, cervix in females, prostate gland in males, and various other areas. ACC tumors are characterized by a distinctive histological pattern of abnormal ""nests"" or cords of certain cells (epithelial cells) that surround and/or infiltrate ducts or glandular structures within the affected organ. These structures are typically filled with a mucous-like material or contain abnormal fibrous membranes. Such characteristics are apparent during microscopic evaluation of tumor cells from a biopsy sample. ACC is considered a low-grade malignancy that has a history of slow growth. Rarely, ACC can be aggressively invasive and infiltrate nearby lymph nodes as well as the ""sheaths"" or coatings surrounding nerve fibers (perineural spaces). This form of cancer may have a tendency to recur later at the site where it first developed (local recurrence) and in approximately 50% of patients, ACC spreads to distant bodily sites, particularly the lungs (metastatic disease), potentially resulting in life-threatening complications. ACC typically occurs during adulthood, around the ages of 40 to 60, but has also been diagnosed in children and adolescents."\n', 'Granuloma annulare is a chronic degenerative skin disorder. The most common form is localized granuloma annulare, which is characterized by the presence of small, firm red or yellow colored bumps (nodules or papules) that appear arranged in a ring on the skin. In most cases, the sizes of the lesions range from one to five centimeters. The most commonly affected sites include the feet, hands, and fingers. In addition to the localized form, there are four less common forms: generalized or disseminated, linear, perforating, and subcutaneous. The lesions associated with granuloma annulare usually disappear without treatment (spontaneous remission). However, the lesions often reappear. The exact cause of granuloma annulare is unknown. Granuloma annulare occurs more often in females than males. The disorder can affect people of any age, but occurs most frequently in children and young adults. The prevalence of granuloma annulare in the general population is unknown. Localized granuloma annulare occurs more often than the others forms. In many cases, the eruptions of granuloma annulare disappear without treatment (spontaneous remission). Therefore, many affected individuals do not require specific treatment. However, the episodes of the disorder may recur. Treatments for chronic forms of the disorder include corticosteroid drugs such as dapsone and isotretinoin, which is the synthetic form of retinoic acid (related to vitamin A).\n', 'Sialidosis, also known as mucolipidosis type I, is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme neuraminidase (sometimes referred to as sialidase). Deficiency of neuraminidase results in the abnormal accumulation of toxic materials in the body. Sialidosis is divided into two types (i.e., type I and type II). Sialidosis type I usually becomes apparent during the second decade of life with the development of sudden involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus), distinctive red spots (cherry-red macules) in the eyes, and sometimes additional neurological findings. Sialidosis type II is usually more severe than sialidosis type I. Type II often begins during infancy or later during childhood and is characterized by cherry-red macules, mildly coarse facial features, skeletal malformations and mild cognitive impairment. Sialidosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Sialidosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of sialidosis in the general population is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 4.2 million individuals in the Australian population. Another estimate placed the incidence at 1-4 individuals per 200,000 of the general population. Because rare disorders like sialidosis often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of sialidosis in the general population is difficult.\n', 'Apraxia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to perform learned (familiar) movements on command, even though the command is understood and there is a willingness to perform the movement. Both the desire and the capacity to move are present but the person simply cannot execute the act. There is little data available on the incidence of apraxia.  Since apraxia may accompany dementia or stroke, it is more frequently diagnosed among older persons.\n', 'LEMS is characterized by weakness and fatigue especially of the muscles in the legs and arms. The disease may affect the patient’s ability to engage in strenuous exercise and may make such activities as climbing stairs or walking up a steep walkway difficult. Onset is gradual, typically taking place over several weeks to many months. There is often a progression of symptoms whereby the shoulder muscles, muscles of the feet & hands, speech & swallowing muscles and eye muscles are affected in a stepwise fashion. The symptoms progress more quickly when LEMS is associated with cancer. Most LEMS patients also exhibit the following symptoms (sometimes called autonomic symptoms): dry mouth, dry eyes, constipation, impotence, and decreased sweating. LEMS patients with or without cancer may also undergo significant weight loss. The tendon reflexes are diminished or absent on examination. Hence, in summary, LEMS is often described as a clinical “triad” of proximal muscle weakness, autonomic symptoms and reduced tendon reflexes. The estimated worldwide prevalence of LEMS is about 2.8 per million, making it a rare disease. There are approximately 400 known cases of LEMS in the United States. When LEMS is associated with SCLC, the patients tend to be older and are more likely to be men than women. The average age of onset of SCLC is around 60 years of age. Approximately 3% of SCLC patients develop LEMS, but clinical symptoms of LEMS usually precede the SCLC diagnosis (sometimes by many years). When LEMS is not related to cancer, the syndrome may occur at any age, and the typical onset is about 35 years of age. LEMS is extremely rare in the pediatric population, and there have only been 11 affected children reported in literature.\n', 'Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by hundreds to thousands of precancerous colorectal polyps (adenomatous polyps). If left untreated, affected individuals inevitably develop cancer of the colon and/or rectum at a relatively young age. FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and caused by abnormalities (mutations) in the APC gene. Mutations in the APC gene cause a group of polyposis conditions that have overlapping features: familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome and attenuated FAP. Familial adenomatous polyposis affects males and females in equal numbers. It occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals in the United States and accounts for about 0.5% of all cases of colorectal cancer. One estimate suggests that familial adenomatous polyposis affects 50,000 American families. According to national registries, familial adenomatous polyposis occurs in 2.29-3.2 per 100,000 individuals. Classical FAP is diagnosed clinically when an individual has 100 or more adenomatous colorectal polyps (typically occurring by the third decade of life) or fewer than 100 polyps and a relative with FAP. Genetic testing for mutations in the APC gene is available to confirm the diagnosis of FAP and the associated conditions. Younger individuals may have fewer polyps. A diagnosis is made in younger people by the presence of the typical polyps and in immediate relative with FAP or by genetic testing.\n', 'Craniopharyngiomas occur in around 0.5 to 2 people per million each year and represent around 1.2 to 4% of all intracranial tumors in children. They mostly develop in two age groups (bimodal incidence peaks): children aged 0 to 14 years and adults aged 50 to 74 years. They occur in men and women equally. Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma are more common, representing 86 to 89% of all craniopharyngiomas.\n', 'Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of rare, genetic, multisystem disorders that were once thought to be separate entities. These disorders are now classified as different expressions (variants) of one disease process. Collectively, they form a spectrum or continuum of disease. Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form; neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy is the intermediate form; and infantile Refsum disease is the mildest form. Zellweger spectrum disorders can affect most organs of the body. Neurological deficits, loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), hearing loss, vision problems, liver dysfunction, and kidney abnormalities are common findings. Zellweger spectrum disorders often result in severe, life-threatening complications early during infancy. Some individuals with milder forms have lived into adulthood. Zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Zellweger spectrum disorders are also known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) - a group of disorders characterized by the failure of the body to produce peroxisomes that function properly. Peroxisomes are very small, membrane-bound structures within the gel-like fluid (cytoplasm) of cells that play a vital role in numerous biochemical processes in the body. PBDs are subdivided into the three Zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.\xa0 Zellweger spectrum disorders are usually apparent at birth. They affect individuals of all ethnic groups. In the United States, the combined incidence of these disorders is at least 1 in 50,000 live births. Because some cases go undiagnosed, determining these disorders true frequency in the general population is difficult.\n', 'The congenital form of arodermatitis enteropathica is a rare disorder beginning during infancy. The incidence is about 1 in 500,000 births and the condition affects males and females in equal numbers. Healthy breast-fed infants of female patients with the disorder can also become affected. The acquired form of AE is rare because in recent years zinc supplements have been added to the parenteral nutrition regimen, although acquired forms are more common in some regions such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where gastro-intestinal malabsorption syndrome are more frequent.\n', 'Graves’ disease affects females more often than males by a ratio of 5-10 to 1. The disorder usually develops during middle age with a peak incidence of 40-60, but can also affect children, adolescents and the elderly. Graves’ disease occurs in almost any part of the world. Graves’ disease is estimated to affect 2%-3% of the general population. Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. A diagnosis of Graves’ disease is made based upon a detailed patient and family history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as blood tests that measure the levels of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Blood tests to detect the presence of specific antibodies that cause Graves’ disease can be performed to confirm a diagnosis, but are usually not necessary.\n', 'Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis (AVN), aseptic necrosis or ischemic bone necrosis, is a disease resulting in the death of bone cells. If the process involves the bones near a joint, it often leads to collapse of the joint surface and subsequent arthritis due to an irregular joint surface. The exact cause is unknown. In the early stages of osteonecrosis, patients may not have any symptoms. As the disease progresses, however, most patients experience joint pain – at first, only when putting weight on the affected joint, and then even when resting. Pain usually develops gradually and may be mild or severe. If osteonecrosis progresses and the bone and surrounding joint surface collapse, pain may develop or increase dramatically. Pain may be severe enough to cause joint stiffness by limiting the range of motion in the affected joint. Disabling osteoarthritis may develop in the affected joint. The period of time between the first symptoms and loss of joint function is different for each patient, ranging from several months to more than a year. Osteonecrosis usually affects people between 30 and 50 years of age; about 10,000 to 20,000 people develop osteonecrosis each year in the United States. Osteonecrosis affects both men and women and affects people of all ages. It is most common among people in their thirties and forties. Depending on a person’s risk factors and whether the underlying cause is trauma, it also can affect younger or older people.\n', 'The diagnosis of Poland Syndrome is usually made at birth based upon characteristic physical findings, a thorough clinical evaluation, and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests may include advanced imaging techniques, such as a CT scan that can determine the extent to which the muscles may be affected. During CT scanning, a computer and X-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images particular organs or structures within the body. X-ray studies may be used to help identify and characterize specific abnormalities in the hands, forearms, ribs, and/or shoulder blades.\n', 'It is estimated that about 69% of those affected are male. The average age at diagnosis is 8-16 years, although the disease has been diagnosed in patients as young as 4 months. About two-thirds of juvenile cases present before age 10. Approximately one-third of patients are 30 years or older before symptoms begin. A diagnosis of Coats disease is made based upon a thorough clinical ophthalmic evaluation, a detailed patient history, and specialized tests, including retinal fluorescein angiography, diagnostic echography, and in some cases computed tomography imaging of the orbits.\n', 'Aspergillus Aspergillosis is a rare fungal infection. The exact number of people who develop this infection in the United States is not known because there is no national surveillance of this infection. Mild cases may go undiagnosed. According to the medical literature, the incidence of aspergillosis is increasing. Aspergillosis has been reported all over the world. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis has been estimated to affect about 1-4 million people worldwide. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is estimated to affect about 3 million people worldwide. Invasive aspergillosis is uncommon. Many forms are rare. Aspergillosis can potentially affect individuals of any age.\n', "Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare disorder that may affect multiple organ systems, especially the lungs. The disorder is characterized by the abnormal clustering of certain white blood cells (hypereosinophilia) in the blood and tissues, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), and the development of inflammatory nodular lesions called granulomas (granulomatosis). Most affected individuals have a history of allergy. In addition, asthma and other associated lung (pulmonary) abnormalities (i.e., pulmonary infiltrates) often precede the development of the generalized (systemic) symptoms and findings seen in Churg-Strauss syndrome by as little as six months or as much as two decades. Asthma, a chronic respiratory disorder, is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the lungs' airways, causing difficulties breathing (dyspnea), coughing, the production of a high-pitched whistling sound while breathing (wheezing), and/or other symptoms and findings. Churg-Strauss syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers, although some reports suggest that males may be affected slightly more often. The disorder can affect individuals of almost any age and has ranged from 15 to 70 years of age. Most cases occur in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. The estimated mean annual incidence is 2.4 individuals per million. Some researchers believe that Churg-Strauss syndrome is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population.\n", 'Triploidy is a rare chromosomal abnormality. Triploidy is the presence of an additional set of chromosomes in the cell for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46 chromosomes per cell. The extra set of chromosomes originates either from the father or the mother during fertilization. Infants with triploidy usually are miscarried early in the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the infant dies within the first days of life. A few affected individuals have been reported to have survived to adulthood, but suffered from developmental delay, learning difficulties, seizures, hearing loss and other abnormalities. Those that survive have mosaic triploidy, meaning that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other cells have 69 chromosomes per cell.  Infants affected with complete triploidy suffer from growth restriction and multiple birth defects. Triploidy is the presence of a complete additional set of chromosomes. The triplication of the chromosomes is caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperms, or the fertilization of an egg by a sperm that has an extra set of chromosomes or by the fertilization of an egg that has an extra set of chromosomes by a normal sperm. This disorder does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. Triploidy accounts for 1-3 percent of all pregnancies. The condition occurs slightly more often in males than females; it is estimated that 2/3 of triploid pregnancies are male. The presence of multiple major malformations, low amniotic fluid and/or growth restriction on fetal ultrasound during pregnancy raises the suspicion of triploidy. The diagnosis can be made during pregnancy by chromosome analysis (karyotyping) of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The diagnosis can be confirmed after birth by chromosome analysis of tissue (skin) obtained from the affected infant. Triploidy cannot be diagnosed by chromosome microarray testing. The accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in the diagnosis of triploidy is still being studied. Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol and pregnancy-assisted plasma protein-A have been associated with an increased risk for triploidy.\n', 'Aceruloplasminemia is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of aceruloplasminemia is unknown. It may be more prevalent in Japan, where it is estimated to affect 1 individual per 2,000,000 in the general population. Because many cases of aceruloplasminemia go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Aceruloplasminemia was first described in the medical literature in 1992.\n', 'Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short limb dwarfism, additional fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), abnormal development of fingernails and, in over half of the cases, congenital heart defects. Motor development and intelligence are normal. This disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome occurs in many ethnic groups throughout the world and effects males and females in equal numbers. This condition has been reported in approximately 150 individuals. It is more common in the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and in the native population of Western Australia. Ellis-Van-Creveld syndrome is diagnosed by the observation of short stature, slow growth, skeletal abnormalities determined by imaging techniques and sometimes teeth present at birth (natal teeth). Molecular genetic testing for the EVC and EVC2 genes is available on a research basis only. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by ultrasound.\n', '"Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities. Most cases have occurred randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out. Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare disorder that, in most cases, appears to occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically).  However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out. Acromicric Dysplasia is an extremely rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Only a very small number of cases have been reported in the medical literature. Acromicric Dysplasia may be diagnosed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings (e.g., abnormally short hands), a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests such as advanced imaging techniques. X-rays may reveal characteristic abnormalities of the bones in the hands and feet (e.g., abnormally short broad phalanges, metacarpals, and metatarsals; epiphyseal coning of the phalanges in the toes; pointing of the last four metacarpals; and the presence of an abnormal notch on the radial side of the 2nd metacarpal and ulnar side of the 5th metacarpal). The removal and study of cartilage cells (biopsy) under a microscope may reveal distinctive abnormalities affecting the growth cartilage. These abnormalities may include disorganization of the ""growing"" portion of certain bones, especially abnormal organization of cells that form cartilage (chondrocytes) and of a protein substance (collagen) that forms fibers within the ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue. In addition, an abnormally high number of such cells may demonstrate degeneration."\n', 'MCT8-specific thyroid hormone cell transporter deficiency (THCT deficiency) is an inherited disorder that is characterized by severe intellectual disability, an impaired ability to speak, diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), and/or movement abnormalities. THCT deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that manifests in males only. One hundred and forty-four males from 56 separate families (kindreds) have been identified, two thirds of whom have been reported in the medical literature. The frequency of THCT deficiency in the general population with intellectual disability is not known.\n', 'POEMS syndrome affects men more often than women and usually occurs during the forties or fifties, although it has been reported in individuals in their twenties. The disorder was originally thought to be more common in Japan than in the United States and Europe. POEMS syndrome often goes unrecognized, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.\n', 'Usher syndrome affects approximately three to ten in 100,000 people worldwide. Higher than average numbers of people with Usher syndrome have been found among Jewish people in Israel, Berlin, Germany; French Canadians of Louisiana; Argentineans of Spanish descent; and Nigerian Africans. USH3, the rarest form in most populations, comprises about 40% of Usher patients in Finland. Usher syndrome is the most common genetic disorder involving both hearing and vision abnormalities. Usher syndrome types 1 and 2 account for approximately 10 percent of all cases of moderate to profound deafness in children. Usher syndrome is diagnosed by hearing, balance and vision examinations. A hearing (audiologic) exam measures the frequency and loudness of sounds that a person can hear. An electroretinogram measures the electrical response to the light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eyes. A retinal exam is done to observe the retina and other structures in the back of the eye. Vestibular (balance) function can be assessed by a variety of tests that evaluate different parts of the balance system. Genetic testing is clinically available for most of the genes associated with Usher syndrome.\n', "Chandler's syndrome (CS) is a rare eye disorder in which the endothelium, the single layer of cells lining the interior of the cornea, proliferates causing corneal edema, distortion of the iris, and unusually high pressure in the eye (glaucoma). CS is one of three syndromes affecting the eyes (progressive iris atrophy and Cogan-Reese syndrome are the other two) that make up the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE syndrome). The spectrum is an acquired, unilateral disorder, which typically occurs in early to middle adulthood and predominantly affects women.  Chandler's syndrome is the most commonly encountered clinical variant of this spectrum. Chandler’s syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects females more often than it does males. The disorder usually appears during young adult to middle aged years. However, its occurrence in a child and a teenager has been reported. ICE syndrome has been described in different ethnic groups, although the prevalence of the 3 clinical variants may vary among ethnicities.\n", 'Complete DiGeorge syndrome affects both boys and girls. The exact incidence or prevalence of this disorder is unknown.\n', 'Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) refers to three rare disorders that many clinicians believe to be intimately related to one another and which represent the range of severity of the same disorder. These disorders are apparent at birth (congenital). As the name suggests, they involve malformations of the eyes, ears and spine. OAVS affects males more frequently than females by an approximate 3:2 ratio.  There is some disagreement in the medical literature concerning the disorder’s rate of occurrence.  Reported estimates range from one in 3000 to 5000 live births up to one in 25,000-40,000 live births.  Most of the physical characteristics associated with OAVS are apparent at birth (congenital), with the possible exception of facial asymmetry, which may not become apparent until approximately four years of age in many cases.\n', 'Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disorder that affects males twice as often as females. Although it may affect individuals of any age, the disorder most often occurs in middle-aged adults. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at approximately 1 person per each 100,000 in the general population in the United States or Europe. Some studies suggest that the incidence of PSC is increasing. PSC is one of the leading reasons people require a liver transplant in the United States. In Nordic countries, PSC is the number one cause for a liver transplant.\n', 'Intracranial Hypertension (IH) is characterized by increased pressure inside the skull. Intracranial means inside the skull and hypertension means high fluid pressure. Intracranial hypertension means that the pressure of the fluid that surrounds the brain (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) is too high. Elevated CSF pressure can cause two problems, severe headache and visual loss. If the elevated CSF pressure remains untreated, permanent visual loss or blindness may result. Pseudotumor cerebri and benign intracranial hypertension are both former names for IH, which are now considered inaccurate. These names do not adequately describe the disorder and downplay the seriousness of IH.\n', 'Split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) is a genetic disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of some fingers or toes, often combined with clefts in the hands or feet. There may also be the appearance of webbing between fingers or toes (syndactyly). This may give the hands and/or feet a claw-like appearance. Split hand/split foot malformation affects males and females equally.  Frequency is estimated at one out of 18,000 newborns. The diagnosis of SHFM is based on physical features present at birth.  X-rays may provide additional information about the skeletal anomalies. Molecular genetic testing by DNA analysis is available for SHFM4, caused by a mutation in the TP63 gene. Mutations in the TP63 gene are responsible for only about 10% of all cases of SHFM.\n', 'Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease affecting the retinas in premature infants. The retinas are the light-sensitive linings of the insides of the eyes. In infants born prematurely, the blood vessels that supply the retinas are not yet completely developed. Although blood vessel growth continues after birth, these vessels may develop in an abnormal, disorganized pattern, known as ROP. In some affected infants, the changes associated with ROP spontaneously subside. However, in others, ROP may lead to bleeding, scarring of the retina, retinal detachment and visual loss. Even in cases in which ROP changes cease or regress spontaneously, affected children may have an increased risk of certain eye (ocular) abnormalities, including nearsightedness, misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), and/or future retinal detachment. The two major risk factors for ROP are a low birth weight and premature delivery. ROP is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in infants in many industrialized and “middle-income” countries. As noted above, an increased incidence of ROP in the 1940s and 1950s was shown to be due to the use of high concentrations of supplemental oxygen in premature infants. The number of cases decreased with measures to monitor oxygen blood levels carefully. However, with modern advances in care and technology in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), the incidence of ROP has increased as more premature infants of lower birth weights survive. Careful control of blood oxygen levels reduces the risk of ROP without compromising measures necessary to sustain life. Again, supplementary oxygen alone does not appear to be sufficient for the development of ROP. (For more, see “Causes” above.)\n', 'Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by slowly progressive shrinkage (atrophy) of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face (hemifacial atrophy). In rare cases, both sides of the face are affected. In some people, atrophy may also affect the limbs usually on the same side of the body as the facial atrophy. The severity and specific symptoms of Parry-Romberg syndrome are highly variable from one person to another. Additional symptoms can potentially develop in some people including neurological abnormalities or abnormalities affecting the eyes or teeth. Parry-Romberg syndrome usually becomes apparent during the first decade of life or early during the second decade but does occur in adulthood. The majority of individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome experience symptoms before the age of 20 years. The exact cause of Parry-Romberg syndrome is unknown and appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder. The true incidence is unknown. Because the disorder often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed determining the true frequency of Parry-Romberg syndrome in the general population is difficult. Physicians studying the disorder have estimated that Parry-Romberg may affect as many as 1 in 250,000 people in the general population.  Parry-Romberg syndrome appears to affect women slightly more often than men but proper studies of the population are lacking. Parry-Romberg syndrome typically becomes apparent during the first or early during the second decade of life, with the majority of affected individuals experiencing symptoms before the age of 20 years. However, the disorder has been described in infants and individuals more than 50 years of age. Parry-Romberg syndrome was originally described in the medical literature in 1825 (C.H. Parry) and 1846 (E. Henoch and H.M. Romberg). There are anecdotal reports of Parry-Romberg syndrome worsening in some pregnant women, either during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. A diagnosis of Parry-Romberg syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. The specific tests that are used depend on which symptoms are present and which symptoms occur first. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in individuals with neurological symptoms. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. Surgical removal and microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue may be used in individuals with linear scleroderma en coup sabre.\n', 'Kugelberg Welander syndrome is a milder type of spinal muscular atrophy. It is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by wasting and weakness in the muscles of the arms and legs, leading to walking difficulties in, and eventual loss of ambulation. Symptoms of Kugelberg Welander syndrome occur after 12 months of age. Patients learn to walk, may fall frequently and may have trouble walking up and down stairs at 2-3 years of age; some patients will not show functional changes until the teens. The legs are more severely affected than the arms. The long-term prognosis depends on the degree of motor function attained as a child. The birth prevalence of all types of spinal muscular atrophy has been estimated to be 7.8 per 100,000 live births. An estimate of the prevalence of Kugelberg-Welander syndrome (SMA3) is not available.\n', 'Autoimmune blistering diseases are a group of disorders in which the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing blistering lesions that primarily affect the skin and mucous and membranes. In autoimmune blistering diseases, antibodies erroneously attack proteins that are essential for the layers of skin to stick (adhere) together. The specific symptoms and severity of blistering diseases vary from one person to another, even among individuals with the same disorder. In some cases, blistering lesions can cover a significant portion of the skin. Although there is no cure for autoimmune blistering diseases, they can often be controlled with treatment. In other cases, autoimmune blistering diseases if left untreated can eventually cause life-threatening complications. In recent years, new insight into the causes and development of these disorders has led to research into new therapies such as the development of drugs that target the specific antibodies which cause the symptoms of these diseases. NORD has individual reports on many of the specific disorders classified as autoimmune blistering diseases. For more information, choose the specific disease name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database. Autoimmune blistering diseases affect men and women in equal numbers. Most forms occur in middle-aged individuals, usually people in their 50s and 60s. However, autoimmune blistering diseases can affect individuals of any age including children. The overall incidence and prevalence of pemphigus varies depending upon the specific population studied. Pemphigus is estimated to affect anywhere from 0.7-5 people per 1,000,000 per year in the general population (Israel has the highest incidence at 16 per 1, 000,000 per year). The incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis has been estimated at 10 in 100,000. The exact incidence of epidermolysis bullosa acquista and the pemphigoid disorders is unknown.\n', 'SLC22A5 CDSP is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Based on newborn screening and reports in medical literature, the prevalence in the US is estimated to be 1:50,000.\n', 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia occurs in approximately 1 in 16,000 to 20,000 births. That translates to the incidence of Kartagener syndrome as 1 in 32,0000 to 40,000 births. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is diagnosed definitively through examination of lung or sinus tissue obtained from a biopsy. Specific structural defects that are present in these tissues can be detected under an electron microscope. Early diagnosis is important in order to provide prophylactic treatment to prevent or decrease damage to the respiratory system from recurrent infections. Screening for levels of nasal nitric oxide (in patients over 5 years of age who can cooperate with palate closure maneuvers) is helpful to identify individuals who may have PCD and should proceed with a biopsy. Currently, mutations in 32 genes are known to be associated with PCD. These do not account for all cases of PCD and hence more PCD genes are yet to be identified. PCD clinical genetic testing is available for some of the 32 genes associated with PCD by the commercial laboratories and new genes are being added to their panels periodically.\n', 'Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) includes at least five rare genetic eye movement disorders present at birth that are characterized by incomitant strabismus. Specifically, there is an inability to move the eyes in certain directions (opthalmoplegia), droopy eyelids (ptosis) and eyes that are fixed in an abnormal position. The oculomotor nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve III) and the muscles it serves and, in some cases the trochlear nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve IV) and/or the abducens nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve VI) and the muscles they serve are affected. Affected individuals have limited ability to move their eyes vertically (upward and downward) and can have variable limitations in moving their eyes horizontally. CFEOM is also frequently associated with droopy eyelids (ptosis) and eyes that are fixed in an abnormal position. Individuals with CFEOM often have their eyes fixed in a downward position, and elevate the chin so they can see. These disorders have been classified as CFEOM1, CFEOM2, and CFEOM3 based on ophthalmologic findings and molecular genetic testing. CFEOM3 can be characterized by additional involvement of the peripheral and central nervous system in addition to the eye findings. Tukel syndrome is characterized by missing and webbed fingers and toes in addition to the eye findings. These disorders do not worsen over time. CFEOM are rare disorders that have been seen in a range of diverse ethnic populations and affect males and females. A minimum prevalence has been estimated to be 1 in 230,000.\n', 'Caroli disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal widening (dilatation) of the ducts that carry bile from the liver (intrahepatic bile ducts). According to the medical literature, there are two forms of Caroli disease. In most cases, the isolated or simple form is characterized by widening of the bile ducts (dilatation or ectasia). A second, more complex form is often called Caroli syndrome. The complex form or syndrome is associated with the presence of bands of fibrous tissue in the liver (congenital hepatic fibrosis) and high blood pressure in the portal artery (portal hypertension. This form of Caroli disease is also often associated, in ways that are not well understood, with polycystic kidney disease, and, in severe cases, liver failure. The simple form, Caroli disease, is apparently much less common than is the more complex form.  Both forms are more common in females than among males. Most often the disorder presents in adults, although cases of neonatal and childhood presentation of symptoms are recorded. When the liver and spleen are unusually large (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly) and intermittent stomach pain is present, the doctor may ask for imaging studies (such as ultrasound and CT scans) to be done. The results of these studies may lead to a diagnosis of Caroli disease.\n', 'Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease transmitted by ticks that commonly inhabit the western United States. Major symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle aches, and/or generalized discomfort (myalgia). The symptoms usually last for about a week and resolve on their own. Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease caused by a virus belonging to the Coltivirus family.  It is transmitted to humans through the bite of the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). Colorado Tick Fever is a rare viral disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Most reported cases have occurred in the Rocky Mountain area of the United States and the western provinces of Canada.  Several hundred cases of this disease are reported each year in these areas where the wood tick lives (endemic).  However, it is possible that many additional cases are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.\n', 'Congenital rubella is a syndrome that occurs when a fetus has been infected with the rubella virus while in the uterus. It is primarily characterized by abnormalities of the heart and nervous system, the eyes and the ears. The fetus is most vulnerable to the virus during the first three months of pregnancy, although pregnant women are advised to avoid exposure to rubella virus at all times. Women who contract rubella during pregnancy have a high risk of having a baby with congenital rubella. Congenital rubella can affect a fetus when a pregnant woman who is not immune to the virus contracts rubella (German Measles).  The baby may also be affected if the mother contracts rubella immediately before conception.  The fetus is most vulnerable during the first three months (first trimester) of a pregnancy.\n', 'A diagnosis of trichotillomania may be suspected if characteristic symptoms are present such as patches of hair loss. A diagnosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of tests that can rule out other causes of hair loss. Because many individuals may be reluctant to talk about hair pulling behavior due to shame/embarrassment, a diagnosis can often be overlooked.\n']

Dev Texts: ['Hereditary ataxias affect males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated that 150,000 people in the United States are affected by, or at risk for, hereditary ataxia. There is variation among the specific forms of hereditary ataxia as to when they typically first appear. Some ataxias are more common in certain ethnic groups.  For example, SCA3 is more common in the Portuguese population, SCA10 is more common in the Mexican population, and DRPLA is more common in Japan.', 'Infants with EI may be born with red, blistering and denuded skin with visible areas of skin thickening. Over time, there is a gradual decrease in blistering, but an increase in the severity of the scaling and skin thickening. Scales tend to form in parallel rows of spines or ridges. A generalized erythroderma (redness of the skin) may be present in some individuals. Skin infections with common bacteria can be a problem. Heat intolerance is common. A palmoplantar keratoderma may be present and can be so severe as to limit ambulation and hand function. Surgical intervention may then be required. On the other end of the scale, there are individuals who have only minimal blistering in areas subject to friction, or have only a palmoplantar keratoderma. Rarely patients are covered in brown-grey hyperkeratotic spines. This is called ichthyosis hystrix (Curth-Macklin). EI occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals. It affects males and females in equal numbers. EI is diagnosed by physical signs and symptoms. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the KRT1 and KRT10 genes is available to confirm the diagnosis.', 'Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 100 families with the disorder have been described in the medical literature. The prevalence of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome has been estimated at 1 in 200,000 people in the general population. Because the disorder is so rare, it often goes unrecognized or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1995. A diagnosis of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., cataracts), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests such as blood tests, which can reveal elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma.', 'Andersen-Tawil syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of the disorder is unknown. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Because many cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of Andersen-Tawil syndrome in the general population is difficult.', 'AP-4-associated HSP affects males and females of ethnic groups from around the world. The prevalence of AP-4-HSP is unknown. AP-4-HSP is likely under-recognized since the symptoms (phenotypic spectrum) largely overlap with that of cerebral palsy and, in the absence of genetic testing, patients may be misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. Many of the initial clinical manifestations of AP-4-associated HSP are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures. Patients may be misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of AP-4-associated HSP is based on clinical characteristics and testing that may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.', 'Ovotesticular disorder of sex development (ovotesticular DSD) is a very rare disorder in which an infant is born with the internal reproductive organs (gonads) of both sexes (female ovaries and male testes). The gonads can be any combination of ovary, testes or combined ovary and testes (ovotestes). The external genitalia are usually ambiguous but can range from normal male to normal female. Ovotesticular DSD is the rarest disorder of sex development in humans and has an approximate incidence of less than 1/20,000. At least 500 affected individuals have been reported. Ovotesticular DSD is diagnosed by a combination of tests including chromosome and genetic analysis, hormone testing, ultrasound or MRI and gonadal biopsy.', 'Glucose-galactose malabsorption is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the small intestine\'s inability to transport and absorb glucose and galactose (simple sugars or monosaccharides). Glucose and galactose have very similar chemical structures, and normally the same transport enzyme provides them with entry into specialized cells in the small intestine where they are absorbed and transferred to other cells. As a result of a mutation on chromosome 22, the transport enzyme does not function properly and the result is glucose-galactose malabsorption. Glucose-galactose malabsorption is an extremely rare disorder.  It’s been estimated that there are approximately 200 cases worldwide. Two-thirds of those affected are females. One report suggests that about half of the cases of severe GGM reported have occurred among families that have experienced intermarriage (consanguinity). The diagnosis is usually made upon review of the presenting signs especially the pervasive, watery diarrhea. A simple test, known as the "glucose breath hydrogen test" is often used to confirm the physical diagnosis.', 'Crohn’s disease is a common disorder, affecting as many as 780,000 people in the United States. The disorder is most common in individuals between 15-35, with approximately 25% diagnosed by age 20. There is another increase in frequency among individuals between 60-80 years of age. The frequency of pediatric Crohn’s disease is increasing; in particular, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of Crohn’s disease in children less than 6 years old; this is called very early onset (VEO) inflammatory bowel disease. Although more women are affected by Crohn’s disease than men, pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in boys than girls. Pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in Caucasians than in people of African descent. It is rare in people of Asian and Hispanic descent. Generally, Crohn’s disease is more severe among children and adolescents than in adults.', 'Potter syndrome is a rare disorder, and the exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. The main cause of this condition, bilateral renal agenesis, occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 fetuses and accounts for about 20% of Potter syndrome cases. The incidence or prevalence of other causes are unknown. Overall, estimates for the incidence or prevalence of Potter syndrome range from 1 in 4,000 to 10,000 births. A couple studies have shown that male newborns are affected more often than female newborns, probably due to the obstructive uropathy that is seen more often in males.', 'Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic skin disorder. In lamellar ichthyosis, the skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) and are not shed as quickly as they should be. The result of this retention is the formation of scale. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare disorder occurring in less than one in 200,000 people.  Lamellar ichthyosis is not limited by gender, race or ethnicity; it occurs in all populations. Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin, and mild keratolytics (products containing alpha-hydroxy acids.. Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids. Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.', 'Most cases are characterized by the gradual onset of symptoms that might be found in the more common type of MS, including muscle spasms and paralysis. Other neurological symptoms develop depending on the areas of the brain that are affected and may include intellectual impairment and/or physiological abnormalities. However, in its most serious form, Balo Disease may also suggest the presence of an infectious disease, starting with a high fever and painful headaches. The cause of MS and its variants remains unknown. However, some studies indicate that autoimmune factors may play a role in the development of Balo Disease. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Balo Disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More cases have been reported from China and the Philippines than elsewhere. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Corticosteroids are usually useful in decreasing severity of acute presentations through their anti-inflammatory actions. Treatment to relieve symptoms, such as spasticity, weakness, pain, or ataxia, includes pharmacologic and rehabilitative modalities.', 'Empty sella syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by enlargement or malformation of a structure in the skull known as the sella turcica. The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression located in the bone at the base of skull (sphenoid bone), in which resides the pituitary gland. In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid and a very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella (partially empty sella) or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland (completely empty sella). Most individuals with empty sella syndrome do not have any associated symptoms, but the finding raises concerns about hormone deficiencies. Empty sella syndrome may occur as a primary disorder, for which the cause is unknown (idiopathic), or as a secondary disorder, in which it occurs due to an underlying condition or disorder such as a treated pituitary tumor, head trauma, or a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also called pseudotumor cerebri) during which elevated intracranial pressure causes empty sella syndrome. Primary empty sella syndrome affects approximately 4 times more women than men. Most cases occur in middle-aged women who are obese and have high blood pressure (hypertension). Because most people with empty sella syndrome do not have symptoms and may go undiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Some researchers have estimated that less than 1 percent of individuals with empty sella syndrome ultimately develop symptoms associated with the disorder, although this may be higher in men compared to women. A diagnosis of empty sella syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized imaging techniques. Imaging may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs, tissues and structures such as the sella turcica.', 'DSS often begins suddenly by age two. Tingling, prickling or burning sensations are usually the first symptoms. Muscle weakness is usually first noticed in the back of the leg. This then spreads to the front leg muscles. Children may have delayed motor milestones, including walking at preschool age or later. Some individuals may need to use a wheelchair by their teenage years. The hand and forearm muscles may become weak as the condition worsens. Individuals with DSS may have respiratory insufficiency, meaning they do not take in enough oxygen or breathe out enough carbon dioxide. Mild vision difficulties may also occur. Other symptoms include pain, loss of heat sensitivity, absence of reflexes, muscle loss (atrophy) of leg muscles, scoliosis (curving of the spine), and ataxia (loss of coordination and balance). Symptoms can vary among individuals diagnosed with DSS. Dejerine-Sottas syndrome often begins by age two. This disorder is thought to affect males and females equally. It can affect people from all races and ethnicities.', 'Cleidocranial dysplasia is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, distinctive facial features and narrow, sloping shoulders caused by defective or absent collarbones (clavicles).  Major symptoms may include premature closing of the soft spot on the head (coronal), delayed closure of the space between the bones of the skull (fontanels), narrow and abnormally shaped pelvic and pubic bones and deformations in the chest (thoracic region).  Delayed eruption of teeth, moderately short stature, a high arched palate, a wide pelvic joint, failure of the lower jaw joints to unite, and fingers that are irregular in length may also be present. Cleidocranial dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Cleidocranial dysplasia is a very rare disorder that is apparent at birth and affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 1,000 cases of this disorder have been reported in the medical literature.  The birth prevalence is approximately 1 in 1 million.', 'CFTR A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be suspected based upon newborn screening, identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency) or a positive family history. The standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis is the sweat test, a painless and simple procedure that measures the amount of salt in the sweat. Genetic testing can identify carriers of the defective gene. In May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DNA-based blood test to help detect cystic fibrosis. The Tag-It Cystic Fibrosis Kit directly analyzes human DNA to find genetic variations indicative of the disease. All 50 States have newborn screening for CF. In most states, immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) assays are performed on dried blood spots from newborns. Trypsinogen is synthesized in the pancreas and IRT levels are elevated in CF. Abnormal IRT results are followed up with sweat testing and/or molecular genetic (DNA-based) testing to confirm the diagnosis.', 'The exact birth prevalence pf pseudoachondroplasia is unknown, but estimated to be 1 in 50,000-100,000.  Males and females are equally affected.', 'Jejunal Atresia is a rare genetic disorder. Patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. Jejunal Atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  Human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the  same for each pregnancy. Jejunal Atresia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  There have been approximately 57 cases reported in the medical literature.', 'Cat eye syndrome (CES) is a rare chromosomal disorder that may be evident at birth. Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. However, in individuals with CES, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In a small number of people with CES, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  The name “cat eye syndrome” is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. This defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat’s eye. There are, however, many other features associated with CES involving many organs and systems. These symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. Associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. CES may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. While some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. CES has been recognized for more than a century. More than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. Many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. However, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of CES in the population. Schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in Northeastern Switzerland. Because some affected individuals develop few associated features, however, the disorder may in some people remain unrecognized. There is currently no way to estimate how underdiagnosed this syndrome is.', 'Meige syndrome is a rare neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary and often forceful contractions of the muscles of the jaw and tongue (oromandibular dystonia) and involuntary muscle spasms and contractions of the muscles around the eyes (blepharospasm). The specific symptoms and their severity vary from case to case. Meige syndrome affects women more often than men. Symptoms typically begin in middle-age between 40-70 years, although cases have been reported in individuals much younger. The disorder was first described in detail in the medical literature in 1910 by French neurologist Henry Meige. No tests exist to diagnose Meige syndrome. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms.', 'Berylliosis is a form of metal poisoning caused by inhalation of beryllium dusts, vapors, or its compounds or implantation of the substance in the skin. The toxic effects of beryllium most commonly occur due to occupational exposure. Beryllium is a metallic element used in many industries, including electronics, high-technology ceramics, metals extraction, and dental alloy preparation.', 'Patients may present with symptoms associated with low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) such as muscle weakness, tetany, and convulsions, or findings related to kidney disease such as proteinuria, hematuria, and nephrotic syndrome. Deafness may be a presenting symptom or may be found on a routine hearing test. Since prenatal ultrasound is now a routine, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract may be the presenting finding. The exact prevalence is unknown, but the disease is considered to be very rare.  So far, about 180 patients have been reported from various countries including the United States, Japan, India, China, Europe and the Middle East. There is equal prevalence across ethnic groups, genders and ages of diagnosis. Clinical awareness of this syndrome will probably increase the number of patients diagnosed. Differential diagnoses of the syndrome include familial idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, progressive sensorineural deafness without renal disease, autosomal recessive hypoparathyroidism with renal insufficiency and developmental delay, and deletion 22q11 syndrome. Barakat syndrome.\n', 'Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular lesion that is a tangle of vessels of varying sizes in which there is one or more direct connections between the arterial and venous circulations. In the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. Brain AVMs are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. The distribution of age at detection for brain AVMs is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30’s. Although a small number of AVMs manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. The lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. The low resistance of the direct A-V connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the AVM. These high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the AVM and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. Further, because of the direct A-V connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the AVM and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. AVM can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. AVM are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. No environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological AVM. AVM does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of AVMs may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-AVM syndrome. AVM can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as Wyburn-Mason syndrome. AVM affects males and females in equal numbers. There does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. The best estimates for new detection of an AVM are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the U.S.) The population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the U.S. who harbor an AVM or have had an AVM that was treated. They occur throughout life, but the peak onset of symptoms is 35-40 years of age.', 'Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body. Affected individuals lack enough functional levels of an enzyme required to breakdown homogentisic acid. Affected individuals may have dark urine or urine that turns black when exposed to air. However, this change may not occur for several hours after urination and often goes unnoticed. Aside from dark urine that is present from infancy, affected individuals generally do not develop symptoms (asymptomatic) during infancy or childhood and often remain unaware of their condition until adulthood. Affected individuals eventually develop ochronosis, which is the bluish-black discoloration of connective and other tissue within the body. Affected individuals may develop discoloration of the skin overlying cartilage within the body such as over part of the outer ear. In some cases, the whites of the eyes (sclera) may also become discolored. In adulthood, affected individuals also develop progressive arthritis of the spine and large joints. The HGD gene codes for the enzyme required for the breakdown of homogentisic acid. Mutations in the HGD gene cause alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria affects males and females in equal numbers, although symptoms tend to develop sooner and become more severe in males. More than 1,000 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of alkaptonuria is unknown. In the United States it is estimated to occur in 1 in 250,000-1,000,000 live births. Alkaptonuria has been reported in all ethnic groups. Areas with increased frequencies of the disorder have been identified in Slovakia, the Dominican Republic and Germany.', 'This is a rare genetic disorder that affects both males and females equally. So far reports of about 50 patients have been published in various databases/ publications. These patients are from families with various ethnic backgrounds from the USA, European and South American countries.', 'SCAN1 has been identified in a single Saudi Arabian family. It has not been identified in other ataxic individuals. The diagnosis of SCAN1 is made on history and clinical signs as listed above. DNA testing for mutations in TDP1 is only available on a research basis.', 'Chromosome 10, distal trisomy 10q is an extremely rare but well-defined chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females at about the same rate. More than 35 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was originally described in 1974 (J.J. Yunis). Many of the symptoms and physical features associated with the disorder are apparent at birth (congenital).', 'Fibrous dysplasia affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is diagnosed earlier in children and young children. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Mild cases may go undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of FD in the general population. The monostotic form is more common than the polyostotic form; according to some reports by a ratio of 4:1.', 'Multifocal motor neuropathy is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, primarily of the arms and legs. The disorder is considered to be immune-mediated, which means there is inflammation resulting from abnormal functioning of the immune system and the presence of specific autoantibodies that target a specific protein in the body. Other symptoms including muscles cramps and wasting (atrophy) of muscles can also occur. The term multifocal means arising from two or more spots. The term motor refers to the motor nerves, which are those that carry nerve impulses from the brain to the muscles. The exact, underlying cause of this disorder is not fully understood. The disorder is acquired at some point during a person’s life; a person is not born with the disorder. Multifocal motor neuropathy usually responds to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Multifocal motor neuropathy affects both men and women, although men are more frequently affected than women by a ratio of about 2.7:1. Men also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age. The median age of onset is 40 years old, although the disorder has been reported individuals ranging from 20-80 years of age. In a handful of instances, the disorder has occurred in children (pediatric cases). Multifocal motor neuropathy is estimated to affect about 0.6 per 100,000 in the general population. Because rare disorders often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult.', 'Agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It is characterized by a partial or complete absence (agenesis) of an area of the brain that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. This part of the brain is normally composed of transverse fibers. The cause of agenesis of corpus callosum is usually not known, but it can be inherited as either an autosomal recessive trait or an X-linked dominant trait. It can also be caused by an infection or injury during the twelfth to the twenty-second week of pregnancy (intrauterine) leading to developmental disturbance of the fetal brain. Intrauterine exposure to alcohol (Fetal alcohol syndrome) can also result in ACC. In some cases mental retardation may result, but intelligence may be only mildly impaired and subtle psychosocial symptoms may be present. Agenesis of Corpus Callosum produces symptoms during the first two years of life in approximately ninety percent of those affected. It has been thought to be a very rare condition but the increased use of neuro-imaging techniques, such as MRI, is resulting in an increased rate of diagnosis.  This condition may also be identified during pregnancy through an ultrasound.  Currently, the highest estimate of incidence is 7 in 1000 individuals. Agenesis of corpus callosum can occur in conjunction with spina bifida. Spina bifida is a term meaning open (or non-fused) spine.  In spina bifida, one or more of the individual bones of the spine fails to close completely, leaving a cleft or defect in the spinal canal. Part of the contents of the spine can protrude or herniate through this abnormal opening that produces a meningocele or meningomyelocele. (For more information on this disorder, choose “spina bifida” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are imaging techniques that aid in diagnosis of agenesis of corpus callosum.', 'Congenital heart block is characterized by interference with the transfer of the electrical nerve impulses (conduction) that regulate the normal, rhythmic, pumping action of the heart muscle (heart block). The severity of such conduction abnormalities varies among affected individuals. Congenital heart block is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  The incidence of complete congenital heart block is one in approximately 20,000 to 25,000 live births.', 'Glutathione synthetase deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 70 individuals from 50 families have been described in the medical literature. The exact incidence and prevalence are unknown. Because individuals may be misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed, determining the true frequency in the general population is difficult.', 'Alpers disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that begins during childhood and is complicated in many instances by serious liver disease. Symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia). Alpers disease usually begins during early childhood, usually indicated by seizures at any age between 3 months and 5 years.  It is characterized by lack of coordination of motor movement, partial paralysis, seizures, and muscle twitching. The child is unable to achieve normal muscle tone (hypotonia), yet the limbs appear to be stiff. On MRI examination an increased density of the grey matter in the brain is noted. Usually, but not always, Alpers disease is associated with liver damage.  Mental retardation may be severe and is progressive.  The loss of intellectual functions such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning may also interfere with a person’s daily functioning (dementia).   In later stages, patients may lose control of the movement of their arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). The liver may become cirrhotic and fail completely, or may not progress beyond signs of jaundice. Affected individuals may also become blind as a result of optic atrophy as the optic nerve degenerates. It is thought that Alpers disease affects males and females in equal numbers usually during early childhood.  However, some clinicians are convinced that the difficulty of diagnosis makes estimating the frequency of this disorder less accurate.  It is probable that Alpers disease affects fewer, than one (1) person per 200,000 of population.', 'West syndrome is a constellation of symptoms characterized by epileptic/infantile spasms, abnormal brain wave patterns called hypsarrhythmia and intellectual disability. The spasms that occur may range from violent jackknife or "salaam" movements where the whole body bends in half, or they may be no more than a mild twitching of the shoulder or eye changes. These spasms usually begin in the early months after birth and can sometimes be helped with medication. They can also occur in older patients; if this happens, they are called "epileptic spasms" rather than infantile spasms. Currently, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has revised the terminology and epileptic spasms is now preferentially used to encompass the different age groups of onset. There are many different causes of epileptic spasms and if a specific cause can be identified, a diagnosis of symptomatic epileptic spasms can be made. If a cause cannot be determined, a diagnosis of cryptogenic epileptic spasms is made.', 'Hypoparathyroidism affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence and prevalence of hypoparathyroidism in the general population are unknown. There are approximately 70,000 people with hypoparathyroidism in the United States.  Hypoparathyroidism can affect individuals of any age.', 'DMD is the most common childhood onset form of muscular dystrophy and affects males almost exclusively. The prevalence is estimated to be 1 in every 3,500 live male births. Age of onset is usually between 3 and 5 years of age. The muscular dystrophies as a whole are estimated to affect 250,000 individuals in the United States.', "Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a rare disorder that, in most cases, affects young or middle-aged male cigarette smokers. It is characterized by narrowing or blockage (occlusion) of the veins and arteries of the extremities, resulting in reduced blood flow to these areas (peripheral vascular disease). The legs are affected more often than the arms. In most cases, the first symptom is extreme pain of the lower arms and legs while at rest. Affected individuals may also experience cramping in the legs when they walk that, in rare cases, may cause limping (claudication). In addition, affected individuals may have sores (ulcers) on the extremities, numbness and tingling and a lack of normal blood flow to the fingers and/or toes when exposed to cold temperatures (Raynaud's phenomenon), and/or inflammation and clotting of certain veins (thrombophlebitis). In severe cases, individuals with Buerger's disease may exhibit tissue death (gangrene) of affected limbs. The exact cause of Buerger's disease is not known; however, most affected individuals are heavy tobacco users. A diagnosis of Buerger's disease may be made based upon the identification of characteristic physical features and symptoms. Many physicians require a history of recent or current tobacco use in a diagnosis of Buerger's disease. A test such as an angiography or noninvasive techniques may be used to confirm a diagnosis. During an angiography, injection of a specialized dye is used to make the blood vessels visible on x-rays.", 'The prevalence of dup15q in the general population is unknown but may be as high as 1:5000.  Dup15q is one of the most common chromosome (cytogenetic) anomalies in persons with ASD. In patients referred for clinical chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) testing due to developmental concerns (developmental delay, intellectual disability, or ASD) or multiple congenital anomalies, the prevalence of dup15q is approximately 1:508. In ASD cohorts, the prevalence of dup15q is 1:253-1:522.  In intellectual disability cohorts, the prevalence of dup15q is 1:584.', 'Trisomy 9p is a rare chromosomal syndrome in which a portion of the 9th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells. They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual. Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females. Each chromosome has a short arm designated as "p," a long arm identified by the letter "q," and a narrowed region at which the two arms are joined (centromere). Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered outward from the centromere. For example, the short arm of chromosome 9 includes bands 9p11 to 9p24, and the long arm includes bands 9q11 to 9q34. In observed cases, trisomy 9p has appeared to affect females approximately twice as frequently as males. As of 2013, more than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was first described in 1970. Trisomy 9p is the fourth most common type of trisomy after trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards’s syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome).', 'Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), also known as Trevor’s disease, is a developmental bone disease of childhood. It is rare and clinical experience with this condition is limited. Most cases are diagnosed before 8 years of age. It is characterized by an abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, particularly of the lower limbs. The bones of the knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected, as well as part of the foot (tarsal bones). The upper limbs and spine are rarely involved. The abnormal cartilage produces an irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone (hemimelic), usually medial. DEH may affect a single bone (localized form), multiple bones in a single limb (classical form) or an entire limb (generalized) usually involving a leg from the pelvis to the foot. Approximately two-thirds of affected children have multiple lesions. DEH was first described in the medical literature in 1926. Trevor recognized this condition in 1950. The name, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica first appeared in the medical literature in 1956. The cause of DEH is unknown. There is no evidence that hereditary factors play a role in the development of this disease. More research is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause(s) of this disorder. DEH is benign and there are no reports of malignant transformation of the cartilage abnormality. DEH usually affects children between the ages of 1 and 15. Males are affected more often than females. The incidence of DEH has been estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. However, some authors consider that the incidence is probably higher because some patients may be misdiagnosed with other conditions.', 'Soft tissue sarcomas affect men and women and individuals of any age and every racial and ethnic group. This is a large group of tumors, but overall, they are still classified as rare disorders. Estimates to their frequency varies. The American Cancer Society estimates that soft tissue sarcomas account for about 2% of all cancers in the United States. However, because rare diseases often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult.', 'Tinnitus affects males and females in equal numbers. It can affect individuals of any age, even children. Tinnitus, collectively, is a very common condition and estimated to affect approximately 10% of the general population. Rhythmic tinnitus occurs far less frequently than non-rhythmic tinnitus, accounting for approximately 1% of all cases of tinnitus and is considered relatively rare in the general population. The exact prevalence or incidence of rhythmic tinnitus is unknown. Rhythmic tinnitus due to pseudotumor and sinus wall anomalies is found most commonly in overweight women in their 3rd to 6th decade of life. The onset of tinnitus can be abrupt or develop slowly over time.', 'SLC6A19 Hartnup disease affects both males and females in equal numbers. The disorder usually begins in childhood and continues into adulthood. The number of people affected by Hartnup disease is unknown. It has been estimated to occur at a frequency of approximately one in 30,000 individuals based upon newborn screening results in the United States and Australia.', 'Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) is a form of meningitis characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord and caused by a specific bacterium known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In TBM, the disorder develops gradually. Treatment with antibiotics and other drugs is usually effective against the infection. Tuberculous Meningitis is a rare complication that occurs in some patients who have or have had tuberculosis (TB), especially miliary tuberculosis.  It can also occur in people who have been exposed to the bacteria that causes TB.  This form of meningitis is caused by a specific bacteria known as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.  (For more information on tuberculosis, choose “tuberculosis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database). TBM is usually found in children aged one to five years although it may occur at any age. Meningitis is usually treated with antibiotic drugs used against the bacteria causing the infection. These may include isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Treatment should last for at least 9 months to one year. Corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone may also be of benefit.', 'Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of the 6th chromosome (6q) is present three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Associated symptoms and findings may vary in range and severity from case to case. However, many affected infants and children have slow physical development (growth retardation); mental retardation; malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; an unusually short, webbed neck; abnormal bending (flexion) or extension of certain joints in fixed postures (joint contractures); and/or other physical abnormalities. In most cases, Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q has been the result of a balanced translocation in one of the parents. Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females equally.  Approximately 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those potentially associated with Chromosome 6, Partial Trisomy 6q.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'Approximately 40 cases of mandibuloacral dysplasia have been reported in the medical literature. Fewer than 10 cases of mandibuloacral dysplasia type B have been reported in the medical literature. Many cases of the disorder most likely go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of mandibuloacral dysplasia in the general population.', 'Chromosome 9 Ring is a rare disorder in which there is loss (deletion) of chromosomal material from both ends of the 9th chromosome and joining of the ends to form a ring. Associated symptoms and findings may vary, depending upon the amount and location of lost chromosomal material and other factors. Some affected individuals may have variable malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. However, in others with the chromosomal abnormality, such features may not be apparent. Chromosome 9 Ring may also be characterized by additional physical features in some cases, including growth retardation, heart defects, genital abnormalities, and/or other findings. In addition, many affected individuals have moderate to severe intellectual disability; however, in some instances, intelligence may be in the low normal range. Chromosome 9 Ring usually appears to result from spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in the development of the embryo that occur for unknown reasons (sporadically). Chromosome 9 Ring is a rare chromosomal abnormality that is thought to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Since the disorder was originally described, more than 12 cases have been reported in the medical literature.', 'Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The disease may develop due to reactivation of the measles virus or an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus. SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Initial symptoms may include memory loss, irritability, seizures, involuntary muscle movements, and/or behavioral changes, leading to neurological deterioration. With widespread uss of the measles vaccine in the United States, the incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has been reduced dramatically, although about 10 cases per year are reported. However, in less developed parts of the world, this disorder is much more common.  In India, for example, the incidence is estimated at about 20 cases per year per million of population.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis seems to affect males more often than females and occurs far more often in children and adolescents than in adults.', 'Ewing sarcoma is a rare bone tumor that occurs most often in adolescents. It can also arise outside of the bone in soft tissue (extraosseous Ewing sarcoma). Ewing sarcoma is related to another type of tumor known as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Researchers have learned that these tumors are associated with the same chromosomal abnormality (balanced reciprocal translocation) and share many physiological characteristics. Consequently, these tumors are sometimes collectively classified as the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). This general term encompasses Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin’s tumor (a tumor of the chest wall). Ewing sarcoma of bone accounts for approximately 70 percent of the tumors in this family. Generally, the term Ewing sarcoma is preferred because, despite the different names, it is one tumor, molecularly. Ewing sarcoma of bone most often affects the long bone of the legs (femur) and flat bones such as those found in the pelvis and chest well. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive cancer that may spread (metastasize) to the lungs, other bones, and bone marrow potentially causing life-threatening complications. The exact cause of these tumors is unknown.', 'FVS affects males and females in equal numbers. There is a 20-fold increase in neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, cardiovascular abnormalities, genitourinary defects, developmental delay, endocrine disorders, limb defects, and autism, when VPA is used during the 1st trimester of pregnancy compared to no use of antiepilepticdrugs.', 'Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, slow growing soft tissue tumor of an unclear cause. \nIt is among the least common sarcomas, representing 0.2-1 percent of large studies of soft tissue sarcomas. ASPS is characterized by a painless mass that most commonly arises in the leg or buttock, with a particular affinity to travel to the lungs as multiple nodules, presumably while the sarcoma itself is still small. This disorder is very rare because it involves a specific breaking and joining event between two chromosomes, called an “unbalanced translocation”. This finding is observed in essentially all people with ASPS examined so far. This finding cannot be passed on to children, however, as the finding occurs only in the tumor cells, not in the normal cells. In addition, there are no families in which multiple family members have the disorder. ASPS tends to occur more often in younger individuals, specifically adolescents and young adults. ASPS tends to affect younger people, especially those between 15 and 35 years of age. It is rare in children under 5 or in adults over 50. Women outnumber men, especially under age 25. There appears to be no link of this tumor to a particular ethnicity. ASPS accounts for about 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. In turn, soft tissue sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all cancers.', 'The incidence and prevalence of tarsal tunnel syndrome is unknown. The disorder is believed to affect males and females in equal numbers.', 'Carnosinemia is a very rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by developmental delays and seizures. Symptoms can begin during infancy and may include drowsiness, seizures that may be accompanied by involuntary jerking muscle movements of the arms, legs, or head (myoclonic seizures), and intellectual disability. The symptoms of carnosinemia include extreme drowsiness and seizures that can occur in children under the age of one year. Slow growth, low muscle tone, motor delays, and delayed intellectual development also occur in children with this disorder. Seizures may be accompanied by myoclonic seizures. By approximately 2 years of age, affected children show variable degrees of intellectual deficit leading to intellectual disabilities and developmental regression. Some affected children also have muscle weakness (congenital myopathy). Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that detects electrical activity in the brain, may be abnormal.  A few patients reported with this condition have few or no symptoms. Carnosinemia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 30 individuals with carnosinemia have been reported in the medical literature world-wide. The diagnosis of carnosinemia may be made by testing the levels of amino acids in blood and/or urine, which reveals abnormally high levels of carnosine and anserine in the serum and urine. Very specialized testing of the blood will detect very low activity of the enzyme carnosinase in the blood. Diagnosis is based on amino acid analysis of serum and/or urine after exclusion of meat from the diet.', 'Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare inflammatory disorder in which abnormal formation of fiber-like tissue (fibrosis) occurs behind the membrane that lines the cavity of the abdomen (peritoneum). This abnormal tissue growth often spreads to affect the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureters). Often these tubes become blocked by the excess tissue. Specific symptoms may vary depending upon the exact location of tissue growth and how far it spreads. In most cases the cause of this disorder is unknown (idiopathic). The exact cause of retroperitoneal fibrosis is not known in about two-thirds of the affected individuals (idiopathic). A drug used in the treatment and prevention of migraine headaches (methysergide) may be the cause of this rare disorder in 12 percent of cases. Malignant tumors are associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis in eight percent of affected individuals. Tissue that has been injured by trauma or surgery may be a factor in some cases. Retroperitoneal fibrosis affects males twice as often as females. The majority of cases occur in individuals between 40 and 60 years of age. However, the disorder can occur at any age, although it is extremely rare in children.', 'Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin condition characterized by abnormally increased coloration (hyperpigmentation) and "velvety" thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin, particularly of skin fold regions, such as of the neck and groin and under the arms (axillae). Various benign (non-cancerous) forms of AN have been identified in which the disorder may be inherited as a primary condition or associated with various underlying syndromes, an excess accumulation of body fat (obesity), or the use of certain medications (i.e., drug-induced AN). In other instances, AN may occur in association with an underlying cancerous tumor (i.e., malignant AN).', 'Primary central nervous system lymphoma constitutes 4% of all brain tumors and develops in around five individuals per million each year, for a total of approximately 1,500 new cases per year in the United States. PCNSL is slightly more common in males. The most common risk factor for the development of a primary CNS lymphoma is an impaired immune system (immunosuppression). This is notably the case of patients living with HIV/ AIDS, especially those who are not treated who have a high viral load and low CD4+ cell count. Other immunosuppressed groups include organ transplant recipients and individuals with congenital immunodeficiency syndromes. In fact, primary CNS lymphoma is the most common brain tumor in immunosuppressed patients. The other main risk factor for developing a PCNSL is age. Most immunocompetent patients are diagnosed around age 60, although cases of PCNSL have also been reported in children. AIDS-related PCNSL most often develop during the fifth decade of life (age 40-49).', 'Over the past decade, important advances in our understanding of complement-mediated renal diseases have led to the adoption of new names or ‘disease categories’ to more precisely group diseases that appear to share a similar cause. Consider, for example, dense deposit disease (DDD), a very rare kidney disease characterized on a renal biopsy test called ‘immunofluorescence’ by an abundance of a protein called C3 in the renal glomeruli, and named for the extremely dense ‘sausage-like’ deposits that are seen in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) using electron microscopy. In 2013, as a result of a consensus meeting, scientists recommended that DDD be sub-grouped under a new heading – C3 Glomerulopathy, abbreviated C3G. The adoption of this new term was driven by the recognition that there is another group of patients with glomerular disease whose kidney biopsy is reminiscent of DDD. On electron microscopy, the deposits in these patients are lighter in color and more widespread in location, but on immunofluorescence, as with DDD there is an abundance of C3 in the renal glomeruli. These patients are said to have C3 glomerulonephritis or C3GN.  In recognition of shared similarities, both DDD and C3GN are now classified as sub-types of C3G. C3G affects persons of all ages, although the mean age appears to be lower in DDD patients as compared to C3GN patients. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at 2-3 per 1,000,000 people. C3G can ONLY be diagnosed by a kidney biopsy. The kidney deposits stain for the complement protein C3 and when examined under an electron microscope, dense deposits are present.', 'Turner syndrome affects approximately 1 female in 2,000-2,500 live female births. It is estimated that more than 70,000 women and girls in the United States have Turner syndrome. There are no known racial or ethnic factors that influence frequency of the disorder. In some cases, the disorder is diagnosed before birth or shortly after birth. However, mild cases can remain undiagnosed until later in life and even during adulthood.', 'Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is a rare genetic disorder of fatty acid metabolism that is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. It occurs when an enzyme needed to break down certain very long-chain fatty acids is missing or not working properly. VLCADD is one of the metabolic diseases known as fatty acid oxidation (FOD) diseases. In the past, the name long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCADD) was applied to one such disease, but today it is clear that all cases once thought to be LCADD are actually VLCADD. VLCADD was originally described in 1992 and is now recognized as having an incidence of 1:40,000 babies. The introduction of heel-stick tandem mass spectrometry for the early diagnosis of VLCAD in newborns has markedly increased the number of infants in which the disorder is detected.', 'Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME) is a rare infectious disease belonging to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses. These diseases are caused by bacteria belonging to the "Ehrlichia" family. Several forms of Human Ehrlichioses have been identified, including Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis, Sennetsu Fever, and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis. Though caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, the disorders are characterized by similar symptoms.', 'Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that most commonly affects women before puberty or after menopause. Although rare, it can also be seen in men. When found in males, the disease is known as balanitis xerotica obliterans. Lichen sclerosus affects mostly females, usually between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Females are six times as likely to be affected as are males. Younger females and males have also been identified in the medical literature in the United States. Female children under the age of thirteen have also been reported with the condition. Lichen sclerosus is diagnosed by looking at the skin affected. All those affected require a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical features, and a detailed patient history. There should be focus on the functional impact of the lichen sclerosus and treatment to date, including over the counter products that might be applied. In order to be sure of the diagnosis, a skin biopsy may be needed. Biopsies may also be performed if squamous cell carcinoma is suspected.', 'Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Associated symptoms and findings typically include delays in physical development before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation); characteristic abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance; malformations of the hands and arms (upper limbs); and mild to severe intellectual disability. Many infants and children with the disorder have an unusually small, short head (microbrachycephaly); a prominent vertical groove between the upper lip and nose (philtrum); a depressed nasal bridge; upturned nostrils (anteverted nares); and a protruding upper jaw (maxillary prognathism) with small chin (micrognathia). Additional characteristic facial abnormalities may include thin, downturned lips; low-set ears; arched, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys); an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and curly, unusually long eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have distinctive malformations of the limbs, such as unusually small hands and feet, inward deviation (clinodactyly) of the fifth fingers, and webbing (syndactyly) of certain toes. Less commonly, there may be absence of the forearms, hands, and fingers. Infants with CdLS may also have feeding and breathing difficulties; an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; a low-pitched "growling" cry and low voice; heart defects; delayed skeletal maturation; hearing loss; or other physical abnormalities. The range and severity of associated symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from person to person. CdLS is a very rare disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Males and females appear to be affected in equal numbers. It has been estimated that CdLS occurs in approximately one in every 10,000 live births in the United States. More than 400 cases have been reported in the medical literature, including affected individuals within several families (kindreds). Multiple affected siblings have been reported in some families. It is estimated that there is a 1-2 % rate of recurrence within affected families.', 'Monilethrix is a rare inherited disorder characterized by sparse, dry, and/or brittle hair that often breaks before reaching more than a few inches in length. The hair may lack luster, and there may be patchy areas of hair loss (alopecia). Another common symptom may be the appearance of elevated spots (papules) surrounding the hair follicles that may be covered with gray or brown crusts or scales (perifollicular hyperkeratosis). When viewed under a microscope, the hair shaft resembles a string of evenly-spaced beads. In most cases, monilethrix is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Monilethrix affects males and females in equal numbers.  The exact number of people affected by this disorder is not known.  Monilethrix may be apparent at birth or by the age of two years.  In some cases, the symptoms may improve at puberty or during pregnancy; in other cases, the symptoms may remain the same throughout life.', "Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WMG) is a malignant disorder of the bone marrow and lymphatic tissues, a type of lymphoma and characterized by the presence of abnormally large numbers of a particular kind of white blood cell known as B lymphocytes. As these cells accumulate in the body, excessive quantities of an antibody protein known as IgM are produced. Large amounts of IgM cause the blood to become thick (hyperviscosity) and affects the flow of blood through the smaller blood vessels, leading to some of the symptoms of the disorder. Small blood vessels may tear leading to bleeding in the nose, gums, or retina. Symptoms of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia usually begin gradually. Common symptoms are fatigue and loss of energy due to anemia. Bleeding from the nose and gums may also occur, and tingling in the fingers and toes is often seen (peripheral neuropathy). Examination may also reveal enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Blurring or vision impairment may also occur due to changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina. The symptoms are quite variable depending on the effect of the thickened (viscous) blood on the organ involved. The causes of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia are unknown. There is evidence of occurrence within families, but such occurrence is uncommon. Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 3.4 million American men and about half that number of American women. The incidence of WMG is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000,000 people over the age of 50. The median age at diagnosis is 67. However, cases have been diagnosed in patients in their twenties. This disorder is considerably less common among people of African descent. When patients show symptoms of an enlarged spleen and liver combined with bleeding of the retina, WMG is reasonably suspected. The results of a complete blood count (CBC) usually show low red blood cell counts as well as low platelet counts. In such circumstances, electrophoresis (subjecting blood plasma to an electric impulse) of serum samples will show a peak reading for IgM.", 'Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. Abnormalities in the feet, heart and kidneys also occur frequently. Townes-Brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the SALL1 gene. The absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus) is the most common feature of TBS.   Small ears and a folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear are usually present.  Congenital sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss can range from mild to severe and can be progressive.   The most common thumb malformations are three bones instead of two (triphalangeal thumbs) and duplicated thumbs (preaxial polydactyly).  Feet anomalies occur less frequently and include a short third toe, overlapping toes and flat feet.  Kidney dysfunction can occur with or without kidney malformations.   Typical kidney anomalies include displaced or rotated kidneys, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, and underdeveloped kidneys.  Abnormalities of the heart, eye and spine are infrequently associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  Mental retardation occurs in approximately 10% of affected individuals. Townes-Brocks syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease.  The SALL1 gene is the only gene known to be associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.  Approximately 50% of affected individuals have the condition as a result of a new mutation.  The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. The prevalence of Townes-Brock syndrome is not known but has been estimated to be at least 1 in 250,000 births.  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The diagnosis of Townes-Brocks syndrome is based on clinical symptoms. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the SALL1 gene is available to confirm the diagnosis.', 'Chromosome 14 Ring is a rare disorder that is characterized by abnormalities of the 14th chromosome. Affected infants and children typically have delays in the acquisition of skills that require the coordination of physical and mental activities (psychomotor delays), mental retardation, growth delays, and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). The disorder is also characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly) with a high forehead; an elongated face; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); a thin upper lip; a flat nasal bridge with a prominent nasal tip; and large, low-set ears. Chromosome 14 Ring is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that has appeared to affect males slightly more often than females.  There have been over 40 cases reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may have features similar to those associated with Chromosome 14 Ring.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'TTD is present at birth. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The estimated incidence is about 1 in 1,000,000 newborns in the United States and Europe. Over 100 patients have been reported worldwide. TTD has been reported in all ethnic groups. An initial evaluation for TTD involves a diagnostic work-up, including obtaining a detailed history of the patient’s prenatal and neonatal history. A detailed physical exam is performed to assess clinical features such as hair abnormalities, short stature, small chin, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment or developmental delay, and bone and teeth anomalies. Evaluation by a developmental pediatrician or neurologist may determine whether there is any developmental delay or intellectual impairment. MRI imaging of the brain to identify abnormal patterns of myelination is often performed. Laboratory testing for immune function, blood count and iron levels can also be performed. TTD is typically diagnosed by polarized light microscopy of hair shafts, revealing a tiger-tail pattern, and at times by measurement of reduced sulfur content in patient’s hair. The classical tiger-tail pattern alone usually is enough to diagnose TTD. However, there are other conditions with similar hair shaft abnormalities and often genetic testing is ordered to confirm the diagnosis. However, there are a few patients with features of TTD who will not have mutations in the known genes. They may have mutations in yet to be identified TTD associated genes.', 'Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare, inherited muscle disease (myopathy) and is characterized by the lack of muscle tone or floppiness at birth (congenital hypotonia). The symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood. However, this disorder is not progressive in adulthood. The first symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy in a newborn are the slow, progressive loss of muscle tone characterized by floppiness (hypotonia) and general weakness.  Early motor skills and other important developmental milestones may be slightly delayed.  Toddlers with this disorder usually have mild muscle weakness and may be prone to falling or stumbling.  The muscles of the pelvis, neck, and shoulder area are most commonly affected.  Since the symptoms of this disease are not progressive during adulthood, most people with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy walk normally as adults.  However, some physical activities may be slightly impaired. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The symptoms of this disorder are most obvious during infancy and childhood.  Nine cases of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy have been described in the medical literature.  Six of these cases were reported in one family. Adults with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy should be encouraged to get adequate exercise and to avoid obesity. Affected adults may experience episodes of mild muscle weakness, but generally there are no major physical disabilities.', 'Fetal hydantoin syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Studies have suggested that approximately 5%-10% of infants exposed to phenytoin during pregnancy will develop fetal hydantoin syndrome. There is no diagnostic testing that can identify fetal hydantoin syndrome. A diagnosis is made clinically based upon identification of characteristic symptoms in an affected infant in conjunction with a history of phenytoin exposure during gestation. It is important to note that the majority of infants born to women who take phenytoin during pregnancy will not develop fetal hydantoin syndrome.', 'Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurring blood clots (thromboses). Blood clots can form in any blood vessel of the body. The specific symptoms and severity of APS vary greatly from person to person depending upon the exact location of a blood clot and the organ system affected. APS may occur as an isolated disorder (primary antiphospholipid syndrome) or may occur along with another autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (secondary antiphospholipid syndrome). APS affects males and females, but a large percentage of primary APS patients are women with recurrent pregnancy loss. Some estimates suggest that 1 in 5 cases of recurrent miscarriages or deep vein thromboses are due to APS. As many as one-third of cases of stroke in people under 50 years of age may be due to APS. Secondary APS occurs mainly in lupus, and about 90% of lupus patients are female.', 'Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a characteristic pattern of mental and physical birth defects that results due to maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy. The range and severity of associated abnormalities may vary greatly from case to case. However, characteristic features may include growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation); malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region; brain abnormalities; and/or additional physical findings. FAS may also be associated with varying degrees of mental retardation, learning abnormalities, and/or behavioral problems that, in some cases, may occur in the absence of obvious physical abnormalities. Researchers estimate that fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in approximately one to two in 1,000 live births in the United States.  According to reports in the medical literature, FAS is considered the primary cause of mental retardation in the Western world.', 'CADASIL is a rare genetic disorder affecting the small blood vessels in the brain. The term CADASIL was first coined in 1993. The age of onset, severity, specific symptoms and disease progression varies greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. CADASIL is an acronym that stands for: CADASIL affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is found worldwide and affects all races. The disease affects approximately 2 to 5 of 100,000 people. Research suggests that the disorder often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of CADASIL in the general population.', 'Mixed cryoglobulinemia is believed to be a rare disorder, but the exact incidence and prevalence in the general population is unknown. Less than 1% of HCV-infected patients in Northern Europe and North America develop cryoglobulinemia while 2-5% of HCV-infected patients in South Europe develop the disorder. Mixed cryoglobulinemia most often presents in individuals between the ages of 40-60. Females are affected three times as often as males. Approximately 90% of cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with infection with the hepatitis C virus.', 'Alport syndrome is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 5,000-10,000 people in the general population in the United States, which means that approximately 30,000-60,000 people in the United States have the disorder. Alport syndrome is estimated to account for 3% of children with chronic kidney disease and 0.2% of adults with end-stage renal disease in the United States. In XLAS, males are affected more severely than females. In the autosomal forms of Alport syndrome, males and females are affected with equal severity.', 'Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The valves allow for blood to be pumped through the chambers. Blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). The aorta sends the blood throughout the body. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males (67 percent) more often than females. The estimated prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 100,000 live births. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 7-9 percent of all congenital heart defects. The symptoms of this disorder are present at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests used to confirm hypoplastic left heart syndrome in newborns include x-ray examination and a special ultrasound test to study the structure and function of the heart (echocardiography).', 'Elephantiasis is a condition characterized by gross enlargement of an area of the body, especially the limbs. Other areas commonly affected include the external genitals. Elephantiasis is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, which results in the accumulation of a fluid called lymph in the affected areas. A diagnosis of elephantiasis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms. A variety of tests may be used to determine the underlying cause of lymphatic damage and subsequent elephantiasis.', 'The estimated incidence of melorheostosis is 1 in 1,000,000. Both sexes are affected and approximately 400 cases have been reported. In melorheostosis, bone scans appear to be markedly positive. However, on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) there is usually a low signal. X-ray imaging is the preferred diagnostic tool for melorheostosis. X-rays often reveal a pattern of thickened bone (sclerotic bone lesions) that resembles dripping candle wax.', 'Laband syndrome, also known as Zimmerman-Laband syndrome, is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area and the hands and feet. Most children with this disorder have abnormally large gums (gingival fibromatosis). Overgrown gums may affect the ability to chew, swallow, and/or speak. In addition, affected infants may exhibit abnormally long, thin fingers and toes and/or deformed (dysplastic) or absent nails at birth. In some cases, mental retardation may also be present. In most cases, Laband syndrome is believed to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, evidence of autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. In most cases, Laband syndrome may be diagnosed during early childhood. The diagnosis may be confirmed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. X-ray studies of the fingers and/or toes (digits) and clinical examination of the nose, ears, lips, and tongue may be helpful in identifying the disorder. Malformation or absence of the nails may be apparent at birth (congenital). Confirmation of Laband syndrome may not be made until gingival fibromatosis is observed when the primary teeth appear.', 'Kienböck Disease is an acquired bone disorder. Abnormalities of the lunate bone in the wrist develops following an injury or inflammation. Recurrent pain and stiffness occur in conjunction with thickening, swelling and tenderness in soft tissue overlying the lunate bone. The range of motion in the wrist may become limited. Kienböck Disease is characterized by degenerative changes in the lunate bone of the wrist.  Softening, deterioration, fragmentation or compression of the affected bone can occur.  These changes may produce pain, swelling, tenderness, thickening and/or stiffness in the overlying tissues of the wrist.  The range of motion may become restricted.  Many individuals with Kienböck Disease have a shorter ulna than radius (negative ulnar variance).  Healing occurs through formation of new bone in some cases. The exact cause of Kienböck Disease is not known.  However, it is believed to be caused by inflammation or injury of the wrist. Kienböck Disease usually begins during childhood and seems to affect females more often than males. Arthroscopic procedures, CT scan and/or x-ray imaging may be used for diagnosis.', 'Schindler disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA or alpha-galactosidase B). The enzyme defect leads to the abnormal accumulation of certain complex compounds (glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides), which have terminal or preterminal N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in many tissues of the body and in urine. Two major forms of Schindler disease exist - a severe form with onset in infancy (type I) and a milder form with onset in adulthood (type II). Some researchers have proposed a type III form of Schindler disease that is less severe than type I, but more severe than type II. The specific symptoms and severity of Schindler disease can vary from one person to another. Schindler disease is caused by mutations of the NAGA gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Schindler disease affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of Schindler disease in the general population is unknown. Because cases of Schindler disease may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are infrequent, although certain disorders may occur in specific ethnic or demographic groups at higher frequencies, about one in every 1,000-2,000 live births for Gaucher and Fabry diseases, or very infrequently (1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births) for most of these disorders, which may be the case for alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Schindler disease was first reported in the medical literature in the late 1980s.', 'Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an uncommon genetic disorder that makes an affected person very sensitive to any of several anesthetic agents, especially those derived from the drug known as choline. When anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. Mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum.  If the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea).  Artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing.  If the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the United States.  Among Caucasian Americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. Apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep.  Infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant’s sleep.  Apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing.  When there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea.  Central apnea followed by or intermixed with an obstructive apnea is called mixed apnea.  (For more information choose “apnea” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'The severity of AGAT varies from patient to patient. People with AGAT typically present with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed speech, and may have seizure activity. Some individuals may develop autistic like behaviors. Children with AGAT may not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals may also have weak muscle tone and tend to tire easily. Fewer than 20 patients with AGAT have reported worldwide. CCDS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.', 'WHIM syndrome is an extremely rare disorder and its exact prevalence or incidence in the general population is unknown although it has been estimated at about 0.2 / million live births. Approximately 60 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Onset is usually in infancy or early childhood. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.', 'Hyperekplexia is a rare genetic disorder that is most often present at birth and affects both males and females. In some individuals, onset of the disorder may be delayed until adolescence or adulthood. Hyperekplexia affects approximately one in 40,000 people in the United States.', 'Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In individuals with the disorder, deficient activity of the SSADH enzyme disrupts the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is a natural chemical known as a "neurotransmitter" that serves to inhibit the electrical activities of nerve cells (inhibitory neurotransmitter). SSADH deficiency leads to abnormal accumulation of the compound succinic semialdehyde, which is reduced or converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid, also known as GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid). GHB is a natural compound that has a wide range of effects within the nervous system. The "hallmark" laboratory finding associated with SSADH deficiency is elevated levels of GHB in the urine (i.e., 4-hydroxybutyric or gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria), the liquid portion of the blood (plasma), and the fluid that flows through the brain and spinal canal (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]).', 'LBSL is an extremely rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2002. According to the nonprofit organization, A Cure for Ellie, as of April 2018, there are about 100 individuals worldwide who have been identified with the disorder. Because rare diseases like LBSL often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'PROS1 Protein S deficiency is a rare disorder that affects both men and women. The exact prevalence the common form of protein S deficiency (the number of people who have the disorder in a given population) and incidence (new cases identified each year) of the disorder overall is unknown. Severe protein S deficiency is an extremely rare disorder and often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine its frequency in the general population.', 'One estimate places the incidence of VACTERL association at 1.6 per 10,000 live births. The true frequency of may be difficult to determine because many cases may be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, especially children with fewer problems. Although many features of VACTERL association are apparent at birth, some features will not be apparent for weeks, months, or perhaps years. The recurrence risk of VACTERL association for parents with one affected child is about two-three percent. No specific test in actually available for prenatal diagnosis, although fetal ultrasound scan may be of some help to exclude recurrence. Because the cause of VACTERL association is unknown, no laboratory test exists that can diagnose or rule out VACTERL association. The diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis based on the features seen. It may take some time to do all the testing necessary to make a diagnosis of VACTERL association. A diagnosis may be made based upon a complete physical exam and a variety of specialized tests that look for the major and minor features of VACTERL association listed above.', 'Enterobiasis or pinworm infection is a common, contagious, parasitic infestation found mainly in children. The disorder is spread by swallowing or inhaling the tiny eggs of the pinworm. Enterobiasis rarely causes any serious physical problems except for the main symptom, which is severe rectal itching.', 'Floating-Harbor syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of FHS in the general population is difficult. As of 2014, approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. However, some of these individuals do not fit the classical description of FHS and were found not to carry mutations in the SRCAP gene.', 'Gitelman syndrome affects males and females in equally. The disorder occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 Caucasian individuals. However, many cases of these disorders may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Gitelman syndrome in the general population. The prevalence of individuals with one mutated copy of a gene (known as heterozygotes or carriers of the disease) is approximately 1% of European populations. These heterozygotes may enjoy a benefit of a small degree of salt wasting: they have lower blood pressures than the general population.', 'Alagille syndrome (OMIM #118450) is a rare genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems of the body including the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes and kidneys. The specific symptoms and severity of Alagille syndrome can vary greatly from one person to another, even within the same family. Some individuals may have mild forms of the disorder while others may have more serious forms. Common symptoms, which often develop during the first three months of life, include blockage of the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis), yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), poor weight gain and growth, severe itching (pruritis) and pale, loose stools. Additional symptoms include heart murmurs, congenital heart defects, vertebral (back bone) differences, thickening of the ring that normally lines the cornea in the eye (posterior embryotoxon) and distinctive facial features. Most people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in one copy of the JAG1 gene. A small percentage (less than 1 percent) of patients have mutations of the NOTCH2 gene. These mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, however in about half of cases the mutation occurs as a new change ("de novo") in the individual and was not inherited from a parent. The current estimated incidence of ALGS is between 1:30,000 and 1:45,000 with no difference in gender. Alagille syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Alagille syndrome has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 30,000-45,000 individuals in the general population. Some cases of Alagille syndrome may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Alagille syndrome in the general population.', 'Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis type III) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a defective enzyme known as UPD-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This defective enzyme ultimately results in the accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) and fatty substances (mucolipids) in various tissues of the body. The symptoms of this disorder are similar, but less severe than those of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis type II) and may include progressive joint stiffness, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and/or skeletal deformities of the hands (e.g., claw-hands). Growth delays accompanied by deterioration of the hip joints typically develop in children with pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy. Additional symptoms may include clouding of the corneas of the eyes, mild to moderate coarseness of facial features, mild mental retardation, easy fatigability, and/or heart disease. Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A diagnosis of pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. A variety of specialized tests may confirm a diagnosis. These tests include detecting elevated lysosomal enzyme activity in serum or decreased enzyme levels in white blood cells or cultured connective tissue cells (fibroblasts).', 'Infectious arthritis is an inflammation of one or more joints that occurs as a result of infection by bacteria, viruses or, less frequently, fungi or parasites. The symptoms of Infectious arthritis depend upon which agent has caused the infection but symptoms often include fever, chills, general weakness, and headaches, followed by inflammation and painful swelling of one or more joints of the body. Any disease-causing microbe may infect a joint.  Bacteria are most often responsible, typically producing an acute arthritic attack.  In young children the most common bacteria are staphylococci, haemophilus influenzae, and gram- negative bacilli.  Older children and adults are most commonly infected with gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci or pneumococci.  Acute infectious arthritis at any age may be associated with rubella, mumps or hepatitis B infections.  Fungi and fungi-like bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc may cause chronic infectious arthritis.  People with rheumatoid arthritis and chronically inflamed joints are particularly susceptible to infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis can affect people of all ages and both sexes.  About half of all cases involve adults over the age of 60.  The incidence is reported as 2-10 cases per 100,000 of general population.  For patients with immunologic disorders, the incidence increases to about 30-70 cases per 100,000 people.  In gonococcal arthritis, the disorder is found in three times as many women as men. A thorough history and physical examination are essential for diagnosis. Blood tests as well as tests of the fluid commonly found in the joints are essential for identification of the infecting agent and to confirm diagnosis. Once the infecting agent is known, an appropriate course of treatment may be designed.', 'Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) is a rare genetic disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Common features of BGS include a distinctive misshaped appearance of the skull, facial (craniofacial) area and bones of the forearms and hands.', 'Banti syndrome is a disorder of the spleen, the large, gland-like organ in the upper left side of the abdomen that produces red blood cells before birth and, in newborns, removes and destroys aged red blood cells, and plays a role in fighting infection. In the case of Banti syndrome, the spleen rapidly but prematurely destroys blood cells. Banti syndrome may occur due to a number of different factors causing obstruction of, and abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension) within, certain veins of the spleen (splenic veins) or the liver (e.g., hepatic or portal veins).  These may include abnormalities present at birth (congenital) of such veins, blood clots, or various underlying disorders causing inflammation and obstruction of veins (vascular obstruction) of the liver, such as cirrhosis.  Increased arsenic intake has also been implicated in some cases.  Also, cases have occurred in patients taking long-term azathioprine, particularly after kidney transplantation. Banti syndrome affects males and females equally.  It is relatively common in parts of India and Japan, but rare in Western countries.  Increased arsenic levels are present in drinking water in some countries and may contribute to regional differences in incidence. The diagnosis of Banti syndrome my be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests, particularly advanced imaging techniques such as a splenic venography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves are used to create cross-sectional images of targeted parts of the body.', 'Ameloblastic carcinoma affects males and females in equal numbers. They may affect individuals of any age including children, but the mean age of affected individuals is approximately 30 years old.', 'Pycnodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that affects both males and females. About 200 people have been reported in the medical literature with this disorder. It is estimated to affect about 1 in 1.7 million people in the general discussion. Pycnodysostosis may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'Binder type nasomaxillary dysplasia is a rare congenital condition that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. One estimate suggests that Binder syndrome occurs in less than 1 per 10,000 live births. However, individuals may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an extremely rare degenerative brain disorder (i.e., spongiform encephalopathy) characterized by sudden development of rapidly progressive neurological and neuromuscular symptoms. With symptom onset, affected individuals may develop confusion, depression, behavioral changes, impaired vision, and/or impaired coordination. As the disease progresses, there may be rapidly progressive deterioration of cognitive processes and memory (dementia), resulting in confusion and disorientation, impairment of memory control, personality disintegration, agitation, restlessness, and other symptoms and findings. Affected individuals also develop neuromuscular abnormalities such as muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass (wasting); irregular, rapid, shock-like muscle spasms (myoclonus); and/or relatively slow, involuntary, continual writhing movements (athetosis), particularly of the arms and legs. Later stages of the disease may include further loss of physical and intellectual functions, a state of unconsciousness (coma), and increased susceptibility to repeated infections of the respiratory tract (e.g., pneumonia). In many affected individuals, life-threatening complications may develop less than a year after the disorder becomes apparent.', "Leukodystrophies are a group of rare, progressive, metabolic, genetic diseases that affect the brain, spinal cord and often the peripheral nerves. Each type of leukodystrophy is caused by a specific gene abnormality that leads to abnormal development or destruction of the white matter (myelin sheath) of the brain. The myelin sheath is the protective covering of the nerve and nerves can't function normally without it. Each type of leukodystrophy affects a different part of the myelin sheath, leading to a range of neurological problems. The leukodystrophies can affect either adults or children, but are more common in children. Some types of leukodystrophy affect males and females equally but other types predominantly affect males. Treatment of most leukodystrophies is symptomatic and supportive. Medications and physical therapy may be helpful for spasticity and motor difficulties. Anti-epileptic medications should be provided for seizures and burning paresthesia from peripheral neuropathy may respond to medications for neuropathic pain. Please review the NORD report on the specific type of leukodystrophy for information about successful therapies. Genetic counseling is beneficial for affected individuals and their families.", 'Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare, neuromuscular disorder that affects the central motor neurons and is characterized by painless but progressive weakness and stiffness of the muscles of the legs. Such weakness may progress to affect the arms and the muscles at the base of the brain (bulbar muscles). Less frequently, the muscles of the face are affected. In most cases, the disorder affects adults during midlife. The exact cause of primary lateral sclerosis is unknown. The exact cause of primary lateral sclerosis is not known. Most cases seem to occur randomly, for no apparent reason (sporadically). Primary lateral sclerosis is one of a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. Motor neuron diseases are characterized by malfunction of the nerve cells (motor neurons) within the brain and spinal cord that carry instructions from the brain to the muscles. Primary lateral sclerosis is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In most cases, the disorder occurs during the fifth decade. However, according to the medical literature a familial form may exist that affects children. The exact prevalence of primary lateral sclerosis and motor neuron diseases is unknown. Treatment of primary lateral sclerosis involves the use of drugs to help control specific symptoms. Baclofen and tizanidine may be prescribed for spasticity, quinine for cramps, and diazepam, a drug that relaxes muscles, for muscular contractions. Additional treatments may include physical therapy to prevent stiffness of joints, and speech therapy may be needed to aid affected individuals whose ability to speak has been impaired by muscle weakness. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.', 'Classic infantile CLN1 disease affects males and females in equal numbers. In the United States, classic infantile CLN1 disease along with other forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis occurs in approximately three in 100,000 live births. Classic infantile CLN1 disease occurs with greater frequency in Finland where its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 190,000.', "Mikulicz syndrome is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal enlargement of glands in the head and neck, including those near the ears (parotids) and those around the eyes (lacrimal) and mouth (salivary). The tonsils and other glands in the soft tissue of the face and neck may also be involved. Although the disorder is almost always described as benign, it always occurs in association with another underlying disorder such as tuberculosis, leukemia, syphilis, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, Sjögren syndrome, or lupus (SLE). People who have Mikulicz syndrome are at heightened risk for developing lymphomas. Mikulicz syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of extreme dryness in the mouth (xerostomia) that may lead to difficulty swallowing and tooth decay.  Other symptoms include enlarged tear glands (lacrimal glands), leading to absent or decreased tears; enlarged glands in the neck (parotid glands); hard, painless swellings (tumefactions) of the saliva glands (salivary glands) of the mouth and those near the ears (parotid).   Glands near the jaw (submaxillary) may also become swollen.  Symptoms may persist for long periods of time or come and go with frequent recurrences. The symptoms of Mikulicz syndrome are very similar to those of Sjögren syndrome and some researchers suspect that they may be the same disorder (see Related Disorders section of this report).", 'Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a term used to describe a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes or RBCs). If the red blood cells cannot be replaced faster than they destroy themselves, anemia is the result.

Test Texts: ['The autosomal recessive forms of glycogen storage disease IX affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked forms primarily affect males, although females can have symptoms, such as enlargement of the liver and, more rarely, females can have symptoms similar to those seen in males. GSD-IX types A, B and C are estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. These disorders account for approximately 25% of all glycogen storage disorders making GSD-IX one of the most common forms of these disorders. Because some affected individuals go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of GSD-IX in the general population. GSD-IXd is extremely rare and its prevalence is unknown.', 'Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the functioning of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and/or receives signals, rather than a structural disease process such as multiple sclerosis or stroke. FND can encompass a wide variety of neurological symptoms, such as limb weakness or seizures.', 'Rabies is an infectious disease that can affect all species of warmblooded animals, including man. This disorder is transmitted by the saliva of an infected animal and is caused by a virus (Neurotropic lyssavirus) that affects the salivary glands and the central nervous system. The symptoms may lead to serious complications if the virus is not treated immediately. Rabies in humans has been almost completely eliminated in most developed countries.  The vaccinations of domesticated animals and elimination of stray dogs has helped control this problem.  In the 1980’s the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had one case per year reported.  In the United States rabies is found primarily among wild animals such as skunks, foxes, bats, and raccoons.  There were 49 cases of human rabies reported in the U.S. between 1960 and 1986.  Only 7 of the 49 cases were acquired by exposure to rabid domesticated animals.  The remainder were from wild animals.', 'Stickler syndrome affects males as well as females. Prevalence rates have been estimated at 1-3 per 10,000 births and at 1 per 7,500 births. Most investigators believe that the disorder is highly under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true prevalence of Stickler syndrome in the general population. Stickler syndrome is one of the most common connective tissue disorders in the United States. A diagnosis of Stickler syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. As yet, no universally agreed upon criteria for the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome exists. A variety of tests such as x-ray studies and eye examinations may be used to detect the presence or evaluate the severity of certain abnormalities potentially associated with Stickler syndrome.', 'X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome is an extremely rare inherited (primary) immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defective immune system that is powerfully responsive to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is common among the general population and is relatively well-known because it is the cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM), usually with no long-lasting effects. However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.  About 400± cases affecting males in more than 80 multigenerational families (kindreds) from several different countries have been reported in the medical literature.  Researchers estimate that approximately one to two in every one million males are affected by XLP.', 'Ivemark syndrome is a rare disorder that affects multiple organ systems of the body. It is characterized by the absence (asplenia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the spleen, malformations of the heart and the abnormal arrangement of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen. The symptoms of Ivemark syndrome can vary greatly depending upon the specific abnormalities present. Many infants have symptoms associated with abnormalities affecting the heart including bluish discoloration to the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the blood (cyanosis), heart murmurs, and signs of congestive heart failure. Ivemark syndrome often causes life-threatening complications during infancy. The exact cause of Ivemark syndrome is not known. According to the medical literature, Ivemark syndrome affects boys more often than girls. The exact incidence of Ivemark syndrome is unknown. The incidence of laterality disorders taken together is estimated to be 1 in 15,000 people in the general population.', 'The specific underlying cause of PRP is unknown, although a combination of a genetic predisposition, environmental trigger, and other unknown causes is believed to play key roles. Vitamin A deficiency was once believed to be related to the disorder, however, this theory lacks sufficient evidence and treatment with Vitamin A has been less than effective.36, 38', 'Congenital syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete treponema pallidum and transmitted by an infected mother to the fetus in the womb. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact. (For information on syphilis in adults choose “Syphilis” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database). In 1998, the National Syphilis Elimination Plan went into effect. One of the goals of this plan was to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis (CS) to fewer than 40 cases per 100,000 live births. The incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns under a year old rose in the United States from 180 cases in 1957 to 422 cases in 1972. More recently there has been a dramatic increase of congenital syphilis, especially in urban areas, that has been attributed in part to crack cocaine use. In the year 2000, the incidence rate was about 13.4 per 100,000 live births, which represented about 529 cases. The diagnosis of CS may be delayed because the symptoms are not always evident. However, any child of a mother infected with syphilis should be suspected for congenital syphilis. If the signs and symptoms are not obviously those of CS, then further testing will be required, including (1) the examination of blood samples for antibodies to the spirochete infection and (2) identification of the syphilis bacterium under a light microscope.', 'Yellow nail syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by malformations affecting the fingernails and toenails, abnormalities affecting the lungs and the airways (respiratory tract), and swelling or puffiness in different parts of the body because of the accumulation of protein-rich fluid (lymph) in the soft layers of tissue under the skin (lymphedema). Yellow nail syndrome usually affects older adults. The exact cause of yellow nail syndrome is not known. Occasionally, yellow nail syndrome has been reported to run in families suggesting that genetic factors may play a role in the development of the disorder in some patients. A diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings. The nail changes in yellow nail syndrome are distinct from the nail changes that occur in most other lymphedema syndromes.', 'In reported cases, leprechaunism has occurred twice as often in females as in males More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Leprechaunism was first identified in the 1948 by Dr. W.L. Donohue.', 'The diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot is confirmed by clinical evaluation and physical examination. A variety of specialized tests including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization may be performed to aid in diagnosis and therapy. When tetralogy of Fallot is present, x-ray studies usually reveal a normal-sized heart that is characteristically boot-shaped (coeur en sabot). Periodic measurements of systemic blood oxygen saturation and hemoglobin are also advisable. Infants with this disorder usually have a relatively loud murmur over the upper left breastbone.', 'Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK) represents a group of rare genetic skin disorders characterized by well-demarcated plaques of reddened, dry, and thickened skin. Typically, these lesions are distributed symmetrically on the body and tend to slowly expand and progress over time. The severity and progression of the disorder can vary greatly from one person to another, even among members of the same family. In some families, PSEK can be part of the clinical spectrum of other rare skin disorders, such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis or loricrin keratoderma. In the majority, the molecular cause of PSEKis not known. The symptoms of PSEK usually develop shortly after birth or during the first year of life. Infants develop reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, especially on the face, buttocks, arms and legs. Over time, these lesions can cover large areas of the body. The distribution of these lesions is almost perfectly symmetrical, meaning the size, shape and location of the lesions are extremely similar on both sides of the body. These plaques are slowly progressive increasing in number and size throughout early childhood before either stabilizing or disappearing sometime later during life. Rarely, waxing and waning may occur. In some cases, the chest and abdomen may become involved. Abnormally thickened or calloused skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) is not uncommon. PSEK affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Darier in 1911. Since then, fewer than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature. A diagnosis of PSEK is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests including genetic testing or surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue.', 'TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is a rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2016. According to the TANGO2 Research Foundation, as of May 2018, fewer than 30 affected individuals have been identified with the disorder worldwide. Rare diseases often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'CIP affects males and females in equal numbers and can affect individuals of any age. The prevalence of CIP in the general population is unknown. According to some sources approximately 100 new cases of CIP are reported in children in the United States each year. However, CIP often goes unrecognized or misdiagnosed making it extremely difficult to determine the true frequency of CIP in the general population. Children are predominantly affected by primary, non-familial, sporadic CIP. Adults are generally affected by secondary CIP, most often due to systemic diseases such as scleroderma, diabetes, or paraneoplastic syndromes.', 'Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) is a rare condition that is associated with a coagulopathy with features including profound thrombocytopenia (low platelets), hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen), and anemia. This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.  If this diagnosis is suspected blood work including a CBC with differential and platelets, fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and PTT should be ordered. The best imaging modality to assess the extent of the lesion is a MRI with contrast. A biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.', 'Sutton disease II is characterized by the recurring eruption of painful inflamed ulcers in the mouth (stomatitis). There may be multiple ulcers of varying sizes. These ulcers in the mouth are commonly called canker sores. Sutton disease II is also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The exact cause of this disease is not fully understood, although it may be due to an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally in the mouth. The exact cause of Sutton disease II is not known.  Several studies suggest that it may occur because of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth.  Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid seem to increase an individual’s susceptibility to this disease. Stress and local injury may also be involved.  There seems to be no relationship between Sutton disease II and menstruation, pregnancy, and/or menopause, nor is it caused by herpes virus, which is the main cause of common canker sores. Sutton disease II affects more adult females than males.  However, before puberty, males and females are equally affected.  This disease occurs most frequently in malnourished children or adults whose immune systems are suppressed (i.e., by chemotherapy) or compromised (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome).', 'HLRCC affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder may be recognized more readily in females because of the development of uterine fibroid and associated symptoms. The exact incidence and prevalence of HLRCC in the general population is unknown.', 'Excessive blood loss during or after delivery of a baby may affect the function of the pituitary gland, leading to a form of maternal hypopituitarism known as Sheehan syndrome (SS). Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called "shock") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the "shock" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland\'s cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known. In patients with severe hemorrhaging on delivery accompanied by long-lasting low blood pressure, treatment is started as soon as possible. Women believed to have the chronic form usually have blood drawn and the levels for several hormones are determined.', 'Osteosarcoma is a form of cancer. It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents. These tumors usually affect individuals in their second decade of life (10-19 years of age), most often between 13 and 16 years of age, which most likely coincides with adolescent growth spurts. There is a second increase in the number of people with osteosarcoma in people over the age of 60. Overall, osteosarcoma accounts for about 1% of all cancers diagnosed each year in the United States. Osteosarcoma affect slightly more males than females and is slightly more common in African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos than in Caucasians.', 'Stomach cancer is a general term for cancer affecting the stomach. Generally, it refers to cancer that arises from the cells lining the stomach. These cells, like all cancerous cells, exhibit abnormal and rapid growth. Early in the course of the disease there are usually no symptoms (asymptomatic). As the disease progresses, symptoms like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and feeling full earlier than normal (early satiety) may develop. The cause of stomach cancer is multifactorial, which means that multiple factors that occur together are necessary for the cancer to develop. These factors can include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental factors. Stomach cancer usually develops randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically), and there is usually no family history. There are about 28,000 people diagnosed with stomach cancer in the United States each year. It affects men more often than it does women, and about 75% of people are over the age of 50. Most people are diagnosed between 60-80 years of age. By some estimates, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. Stomach cancer can affect people of all races and ethnic groups but occurs with greater frequency in individuals of African or Hispanic heritage and Native Americans. Worldwide, stomach cancer is more common in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America.', 'Clostridium botulinum. The clinical diagnosis of botulism may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and a detailed patient history. The mouse bioassay is the “gold standard” method for laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and may demonstrate the presence of botulinum toxin in serum, gastric fluid, stool, or food (foodborne botulism) specimens. Botulism can also be confirmed by culture of C. botulinum organisms from gastric fluid, stool, or a contaminated wound (wound botulism).', 'Acquired lipodystrophy is a general term for types of lipodystrophy that are not inherited, but rather acquired at some point during life. Acquired lipodystrophies do not have a direct genetic cause, but rather many different factors may be involved. Acquired lipodystrophies can be caused by medications, autoimmunity or for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Subtypes of acquired lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and high active antiretroviral induced lipodystrophy, which may develop in HIV-infected individuals undergoing a specific form of treatment. Onset of acquired forms of lipodystrophy can occur during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals develop characteristic loss of body fat (adipose tissue) affecting specific areas of the body, especially the arms, legs, face, neck, and chest or thoracic regions. In some cases, metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance can develop. Such complications include an inability to break down glucose (glucose intolerance), elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), and diabetes. Additional symptoms such as fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver or hepatic steatosis) may also occur. AGL and APL generally affect women more than men, although this may be due in part to ascertainment bias because women tend to be more severely affected and more easily recognized. APL has been reported in approximately 250 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:4. It has been reported in individuals of various different ethnicities. AGL has been reported in approximately 100 individuals with a male to female ratio of 1:3. Most cases have been reported in Caucasians. LD-HIV is estimated to affect approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Consistent with the increase prevalence of HIV in males, LD-HIV is also more prevalent in males.', 'SWS affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 20,000-50,000 live births. Approximately 3 in 1,000 babies are born with a port-wine birthmark, but only approximately 6% of individuals with a port-wine birthmark on the face develop the neurological abnormalities associated with SWS. The risk increases to 26% when the port-wine birthmark is on the forehead, temple region or upper part of the face. SWS can affect individuals of any race or ethnicity.', "There are three inherited disorders of fructose metabolism that are recognized and characterized. Essential fructosuria, is a mild disorder not requiring treatment, while Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) and Hereditary fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency (HFBP) are treatable and controllable but must be taken seriously. Hereditary Fructose Intolerance may be diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter when the infant is weaned. Like other autosomal disorders it is equally distributed among males and females.  Estimates of the incidence of the disorder range widely from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 births. A diagnosis of HFI can be definitively confirmed by either of two tests: an enzyme assay, requiring a liver biopsy, to determine the level of aldolase activity or a fructose tolerance test in which the patient's response to intravenous fructose feeding is carefully monitored. It should be carefully noted, however, that each of these tests carries with it a substantial risk, especially to a newborn child. A non-invasive DNA test is increasingly being recommended instead.", 'Two types of hyperprolinemia are recognized by physicians and clinical researchers. Each represents an inherited inborn error of metabolism involving the amino acid, proline. Proline is abundant in nature and readily found in a variety of foods. Hyperprolinemia Type I is the result of proline oxidase deficiency and is characterized by an abnormally high proline blood level.  Levels of the amino acids hydroxyproline and glycine in the blood are also higher than normal.  Some clinicians believe that kidney abnormalities may be associated with HP-I, although this is disputed.  The signs and symptoms of HP-I, other than the high levels of amino acids in the blood and urine, are vague.  Often, this disorder is described as benign. Hyperprolinemia Type I is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  It affects males and females in equal numbers. HP-I is recognized by elevated blood proline levels. (The normal level is approximately 450 units, but people with HP-1 may have levels of 1900 to 2000 units.. Often, the diagnosis is made by exclusion. After failure to arrive at a diagnosis by other means, a blood proline level is ordered. The result confirms the diagnosis.', 'Locked-in syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Locked-in syndrome can affect individuals of all ages including children, but most often is seen in adults who are more at risk for brain stroke and bleeding. Because cases of locked-in syndrome may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the actual number of individuals who have had the disorder in the general population.', 'Swyer syndrome affects girls who have an XY chromosomal makeup, no ovaries, but functional female organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes and vagina. The exact incidence is unknown. One estimate placed the incidence at 1 in 80,000 births. Another estimate placed the incidence of Swyer syndrome (complete gonadal dysgenesis) and partial gonadal dysgenesis combined at 1 in 20,000 births. Genital anomalies in general occur in approximately 1 in 4,500 births.', "Oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome (OMIM 164180), a rare genetic disorder, is apparent at birth (congenital). The disorder is characterized primarily by eye (ocular), brain (e.g., cerebral), and skin (cutaneous) malformations. For example, many affected infants have semisolid or fluid-filled swellings (cysts) within the cavities of the skull (orbits) that accommodate the eyeballs and associated structures. In most patients, the eye on the affected side or sides is also abnormally small (microphthalmos). Brain abnormalities associated with OCC syndrome may include enlargement of the ventricular system, multiple fluid-filled spaces within and malformations of the outer region of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex), absence of the band of nerve fibers that joins the brain's hemispheres (agenesis of the corpus callosum), and a typical malformation of mid- and hindbrain. Affected infants and children often have intellectual disability and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures). In addition, OCC syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment or absence of skin in certain localized regions (focal dermal hypoplasia or aplasia) and most have protruding, flesh-colored or brownish outgrowths of skin (cutaneous tags) within certain facial areas, including around the eyelids, on the cheeks, or near the ears. In all individuals with OCC syndrome known so far, the disorder occurs sporadically (with no family history of similar disorders). OCC syndrome has been reported more frequently in males than in females; however, the prevalence is unknown. Since the disorder was originally described in 1981 (JW Delleman & JWE Oorthuys), approximately 40 patients have been reported in the medical literature.", 'Arthrogryposis is a general or descriptive term for the development of nonprogressive contractures affecting one or more areas of the body prior to birth (congenitally). A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.', 'ADEM can develop at any age, but is much more frequent in children than adults. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, although a slight male preponderance was seen in a couple pediatric studies. In children, the mean at presentation is between 5-8 years old. The exact incidence of ADEM in the general population is unknown. One study conducted in San Diego, California estimated the incidence of ADEM in persons under 20 years of age at .4 per 100,000. ADEM seems to peak in the winter and spring months in studies conducted in the United States. A diagnosis of ADEM is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues and can demonstrate characteristic brain lesions in individuals with ADEM. Additional tests to exclude other conditions may also be performed. Such tests may include infectious, immunologic, and metabolic tests.', 'Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare disorder. One estimate places the prevalence at below 5 people per every 10,000 in the general population. Prevalence is the number of people who have a disorder in a specific population at a given time; such as how many people have neurotrophic keratitis in the United States in a given year.', 'Kohler disease is a rare bone disorder of the foot in children that may be the result of stress-related compression at a critical time during the period of growth. It is characterized by limping caused by pain and swelling in the foot. It most often occurs in children between the ages 3-7, and affects males five times more often than females. Usually, just one foot is affected so children typically walk on the side portion of the foot. A diagnosis of Kohler disease is suspected based on the presence of the signs of symptoms in the child. The clinical diagnosis of Kohler disease is reinforced by X-rays that show flattening, sclerosis, and fragmentation of the navicular bone, which can be compared to the unaffected side to make the diagnosis. However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.', 'Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy). In addition, some physicians may recommend specialized sleep studies to evaluate sleep disturbances and possible PLMS, but sleep studies are not needed to diagnose uncomplicated RLS.', 'NGLY1 NGLY1 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2012. According to the NGLY1 Foundation, as of January 2018, there are approximately 63 individuals worldwide who have been identified with the disorder. Rare diseases like NGLY1 deficiency often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is eliminated (excreted) in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally eliminated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of the filtering units of the kidneys (nephrons). In most affected individuals, the condition causes no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) or serious effects. When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Renal glycosuria is a rare condition that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  Reported cases of the disorder include affected individuals in several multigenerational families (kindreds).  In most individuals with renal glycosuria, no associated symptoms are apparent (asymptomatic).  Less commonly, under certain conditions, such as during pregnancy or starvation, serious symptoms and findings may become apparent (e.g., dehydration, ketosis). Renal glycosuria is diagnosed based upon laboratory tests that confirm the presence of glucose in the urine in association with normal or low blood glucose levels. (Such testing is typically conducted after overnight fasting.)', 'Kabuki syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Kabuki syndrome is unknown, but has been estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 32,000-86,000 individuals in the general population. More than 400 affected individuals who have genetically proven Kabuki syndrome have been reported in the medical literature. Although the disorder was first reported in Japan, Kabuki syndrome has since been reported in a wide variety of different ethnic groups.', 'Central core disease (CCD) is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder that is classified as a congenital myopathy, meaning that it is a muscle disorder (myopathy) that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) resulting in abnormal "floppiness", muscle weakness, and a variety of skeletal abnormalities such as side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Muscle weakness normally affects the proximal muscles, which are those muscles closest to the center of the body such as the muscles of the shoulder, pelvis and upper arms and legs. Affected infants may experience delays in acquiring motor milestones such as crawling or walking. Some individuals with CCD may be susceptible to developing malignant hyperthermia, a condition in which individuals develop adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs. CCD may be very mild or may cause serious complications. Most cases are inherited as autosomal dominant trait and associated with nonprogressive muscle disease and a favorable prognosis. Some cases are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and are more likely to be associated with severe complications.', 'Trisomy 18 syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a critical region of chromosome 18 appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In some cases, the chromosomal abnormality may be present in only a percentage of cells, whereas other cells contain the normal chromosomal pair (mosaicism). Trisomy 18 syndrome was originally known as Edwards syndrome, after one of the investigators (JH Edwards) who initially recognized the condition as a distinct disease entity in 1960.  The syndrome appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three or four to one. Large population surveys indicate that it occurs in about one in 5,000 to 7,000 live births.  The frequency of trisomy 18 syndrome increases with advancing age of the mother. Reports indicate that the mean maternal age is 32.5 years.', 'The specific cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 – 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma. Other soft tissue tumors, such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, lipomatous hemangiopericytoma, non-lipogenic sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, can also look similar to liposarcoma when initially evaluated under a microscope.', 'Acquired neuromyotonia is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system malfunctions so that it damages parts of one’s own body. Approximately 40% of affected individuals have antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC’s) that affect the points at which the signals from the nerve fiber meet the muscle cell (neuromuscular junction). Aquired neuromyotonia is a rare disorder affecting males and females but is slightly more common among men. Disease onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 60 years but has also been reported in childhood. The diagnosis of acquired neuromyotonia is based on the presence of continuous muscle contractions (myokymia), especially in the face and hands, rhythmic tics or twitches (fasciculations), and muscle cramps. The diagnosis is confirmed by studies of the electrical signs of muscle activity (electromyography).', 'Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a rare neurological condition in which one-half of the brain, or one side of the brain, is abnormally larger than the other. The structure of the brain on the affected side may be markedly abnormal or show only subtle changes. In either case, as a consequence of this size and structural differences, the enlarged brain tissue causes frequent seizures, often associated with cognitive or behavioral disabilities. Seizures in association with HME often begin in early infant life including an association with infantile spasms. Hemimegalencephaly may occur as an isolated or sporadic brain malformation or it may be associated with other neurodevelopmental syndromes. Thus, when detected, HME should prompt a search for other syndromic diagnoses. Hemimegalencephaly is a very rare disorder for which prevalence estimates are not available. Examination by MRI is usually sufficient to confirm a suspected case of HME. Thus, an MRI examination should be performed as soon as HME is suspected. Seizures are diagnosed and defined by electroencephalography (EEG).', 'Apert syndrome is estimated to occur in about one in 65,000 births. Males and females seem to have Apert syndrome in relatively equal numbers. Over 300 cases have been reported since the disorder was originally described in 1894 and 1906. Asian individuals have been reported to have the highest incidence of Apert syndrome.', 'Introduction Nevus sebaceus syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact prevalence and incidence of the disorder in the general population are unknown. Epidermal nevi (as an isolated finding or a part of a syndrome) have been reported to occur in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births.', 'Amniotic band syndrome is a well-known condition potentially associated with a variety of different birth defects. The abnormalities occur after the affected parts of the body have formed normally in early development. The severity of amniotic band syndrome can range from a single, isolated finding to multiple, disfiguring complications. The arms and legs are most often affected. The head and face and, in some patients, various internal organs can also be affected. The exact cause of amniotic band syndrome is unknown and controversial. Two main theories have been proposed to explain the development of the disorder. One theory attributes the disorder to causes that arise internally within the fetus (intrinsic theory); the other theory attributes the disorder to causes acting upon the fetus externally (extrinsic theory). It is likely that both internal and external factors can cause the amniotic band syndrome, and that the cause of the disorder in one infant may be different from the cause in another infant.', 'Carney complex affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 600 affected individuals have been reported since the disorder was first described in the medical literature in 1985. The disorder can present at any age, but the mean age at diagnosis is 20.', 'Factor XIII deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms can become apparent at any age. Individuals of any race or ethnicity can be affected. The incidence of factor XIII deficiency has been estimated to be between 1 in 2,000,000-5,000,000 people in the general population. However, factor XIII deficiency can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency. Most researchers believe that the disorder is under-diagnosed. The incidence of factor XIII deficiency tends to be higher in countries where marriage to close relatives (consanguineous marriage) is more common.', 'The exact cause of CMTC is not known. Most cases occur randomly, for no apparent reason (spontaneously). Researchers believe that the disease results from genetic mosaicism. One theory suggests that abnormal pericyte recruitment can cause skin capillaries to contract inappropriately. In a few rare cases, it has appeared that CMTC may occasionally run in families (familial cases). CMTC affects males and females in equal numbers and is present at birth (congenital). Fewer than 300 cases of CMTC have been reported in the medical literature. Since many cases of CMTC are mild and clear up without treatment, the disorder may be under-diagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of CMTC in the general population. The diagnosis of CMTC may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings.', 'Congenital disorders of glycosylation affect males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence of these disorders is the general population is unknown. Researchers believe that many cases go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency. As these disorders become better known and more subtypes are identified, more cases should be recognized. The most common type (PMM2-CDG) has been reported in more than 700 individuals. In most cases, these disorders become apparent in infancy.', 'Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare multisystem primary immunodeficiency disorder. Symptoms often become apparent early during infancy or childhood. The disorder is characterized by repeated bacterial infections of the skin and lungs (pneumonia), skeletal abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. The first symptom is often the development of a dry, red flaky skin rash (eczema) at birth or early during infancy. Researchers have discovered that mutations in the STAT3 gene cause AD-HIES in over 60% of the patients. Most cases of AD-HIES occur as the result of a new mutation in this gene. There are two main forms of hyper IgE syndrome - one inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and one in an autosomal recessive pattern. Both involve defects of the immune system and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (hyper IgE) in the blood. For years, researchers considered them different expressions of the same disorder, but now researchers consider them similar, yet distinct disorders.', 'Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna is characterized by the thickening of the frontal bone of the skull. It is not clear that this disorder is actually rare. Some clinicians believe that it may be a common abnormality found in as many as 12 percent of the female population. The disorder may be found associated with a variety of conditions such as seizures, headaches, obesity, diabetes insipidus, excessive hair growth and sex gland disturbances. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and elevated serum calcium may occur. Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna affects females 9 times more often than males. This disorder presents itself most often among the middle-aged and elderly but has also been found in adolescents.', 'Kniest dysplasia is one of several forms of dwarfism that is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene known as COL2A1. This gene is involved in the production of a particular protein that forms type 2 collagen, which is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissue. Changes in the composition of type 2 collagen lead to abnormal skeletal growth and, thus, to a variety of dwarfing conditions known as skeletal dysplasias. Kniest Syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Newborns with this disorder are clearly in distress so that x-rays may be ordered. Diagnosis may frequently be made on the basis of the radiographs developed, while a bone biopsy usually clarifies more ambiguous cases.', 'Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a rare infectious disease that belongs to a group of diseases known as the Human Ehrlichioses. The Ehrlichioses are infectious diseases caused by bacteria in the "Ehrlichia" family. Several forms of Human Ehrlichial infection have been identified including Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE), Sennetsu Fever, and Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME). Though caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, the disorders are all characterized by similar symptoms.', 'Addison’s disease affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 1 in 100,000 people in United States have Addison’s disease. The overall prevalence is estimated to be between 40 and 60 people per million of the general population. Because cases of Addison’s disease may go undiagnosed, it is difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Addison’s disease can potentially affect individuals of any age, but usually occurs in individuals between 30-50 years of age. Addison’s disease was first identified in the medical literature in 1855 by a physician named Thomas Addison.', 'The epidemiology of mesenteric panniculitis has not been fully defined. A recent study reported that findings consistent with mesenteric panniculitis occurred in 359 patients (0.24%) from a total of 147,794 abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations undertaken for over a 5-year period in a large community based medical system. Of these, 100 patients (28%) had known malignancy or were later diagnosed with cancer. In some reports, mesenteric panniculitis has a male predominance of 2:1. Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging. Such conditions include primary or metastatic mesentery cancer, gastrointestinal lymphoma, desmoid tumors, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), Crohn’s disease, idiopathic nodular panniculitis, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal fibrosis and other sclerotic diseases as mentioned above.', 'The symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia usually begin at birth or shortly thereafter and include the tendency to bruise and bleed easily and sometimes profusely, especially after surgical procedures. Other symptoms may include susceptibility to easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), bleeding from the gums (gingival), intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or variably large red or purple colored spots on the skin that are caused by bleeding in the skin (purpura). Women with GT often also have unusually heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular uterine bleeding, and excess bleeding in childbirth. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. The severity of the symptoms varies greatly. Some affected individuals have mild bruising and others have severe hemorrhages that can be life threatening. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The symptoms of this disease are usually apparent at birth (neonates) or during infancy. Approximately 500 cases have been reported, but many cases have probably not been reported. This condition occurs with greater frequency in populations in which intermarriage within a group (consanguinity) is more prevalent such as in some regions of the Middle East, India, and France.', 'The incidence of small cell lung cancer in the United States has been declining over the last two decades, which most researchers attribute to the decline in smoking in the country. Lung cancer, as a group, is the second most common form of cancer in the United States. SCLC accounts for about 10%-15% of people who have lung cancer. There are about 30,000 to 35,000 new people diagnosed with SCLC each year in the United States. Almost everyone who develops SCLC has a history of smoking. It is extremely rare in individuals who have never smoked.', 'Chordomas can affect individuals of any age, including young children, but most often are diagnosed in individuals between 40-75 years of age (the average age at diagnosis is 55 years). Collectively, chordomas affect males more often than females by a ratio of approximately 2:1. However, skull base tumors have an equal (1:1) gender distribution. Children are more likely to have skull base tumors. Chordomas account for approximately 1-4% of all malignant bone tumors and around 20% of primary tumors of the spinal column. The incidence of chordoma is estimated to be approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people. About 300 new cases of chordoma are diagnosed in the United States each year. Some reports state that these tumors are more common in individuals of European ancestry. Chondrosarcoma is a general term for a type of bone cancer that arises from cartilage cells. Cartilage is the specialized tissue that serves as a buffer or cushion at joints. Most of the skeleton of an embryo consists of cartilage, which is slowly converted into bone. Chondrosarcomas typically affect the arms, legs, and pelvis, but can affect any area that contains cartilage including the skull base and spinal column. Most cases are diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 60. Chondrosarcomas are malignant and may spread to other areas of the body. (For more information on this disorder, choose “chondrosarcoma” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, or long lasting, progressive liver disorder that mostly affects women and usually appears during middle age. PBC leads to inflammation and scarring of the small bile ducts (the plumbing system of the liver which transports bile, the substance that helps digest fat). When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person’s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years. However, the disorder has been diagnosed in females as young as 22 years of age and in females in their early 90s. It has been estimated that PBC is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting nearly 1 in 1000 women over the age of 40.', 'Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder of respiratory control and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation, with endocrine system abnormalities. Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep – despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) – allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS). Different types of mutations can occur in this gene which will determine how severely an individual with CCHS is affected. Stepwise testing for PHOX2B mutations should be done with close involvement by a physician and genetic counselor.  (For more information about this disease, choose “CCHS” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'Bloom syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature; increased skin sensitivity to ultraviolet rays from the sun (photosensitivity); multiple small dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia) over the nose and cheeks resembling a butterfly in shape; mild immune deficiency with increased susceptibility to infections; and most importantly, a markedly increased susceptibility to many types of cancer, especially leukemia, lymphoma and gastrointestinal tract tumors. Bloom syndrome is a prototype of a group of genetic conditions known as chromosome breakage syndromes. The genetic abnormality in Bloom syndrome causes problems with DNA repair, resulting in a high number of chromosome breaks and rearrangements. The abnormal DNA repair is responsible for the increased risk for cancer.', 'Erythema multiforme (EM) is the name applied to a group of hypersensitivity disorders, affecting mostly children and young adults, and characterized by symmetric red, patchy lesions, primarily on the arms and legs. The cause is unknown, but EM frequently occurs in association with herpes simplex virus, suggesting an immunologic process initiated by the virus. In half of the cases, the triggering agents appear to be medications, including anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antibiotics. In addition, some cases appear to be associated with infectious organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and many viral agents. Erythema multiforme is a rare disorder that affects slightly more males than females.  It may begin at any age, but is most common in children and young adults. Usually, the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the size, shape, color and distribution of the target lesions.', 'A good history and physical exam are often sufficient to make the diagnosis, although specialized tests including surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected tissue may be necessary at times. The continual shedding of large sheets of skin distinguishes peeling skin syndrome from Netherton syndrome and from other types of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, such as congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. The skin of so-called “collodion babies” peels off after a few weeks and does not return, in contrast to patients with peeling skin syndrome whose symptoms return time after time.', 'MSUD affects males and females in equal numbers. Estimated incidence is 1 in 185,000 live births. Due to a founder effect, the disorder occurs with greater frequency among individuals in the Mennonite populations in the United States, where the incidence is estimated to be as high as in 1 in 380. MSUD occurs in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with an incidence estimated at 1:26,000 live births.', 'Myofibrillar myopathies are a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders that may be diagnosed in childhood but most often appear after 40 years of age. These conditions are highly variable but are characterized by a slowly progressive muscle weakness that can involve skeletal and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle weakness can be present in the muscles close to the center of the body (proximal) as well as the distal muscles. A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) is common and may manifest as arrhythmia, conduction defects or congestive heart failure. The frequency of myofibrillar myopathies has not been estimated.  It is likely that these conditions are unrecognized and underdiagnosed. A diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathies is made based on clinical findings, electromyography, nerve conduction studies and muscle biopsy. Molecular genetic testing for the DES, CRYAB, MYOT, LDB3 and ZASP genes is available to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing for the BAG3 gene is available on a research basis only.', 'Frontonasal dysplasia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The number of people affected by this disorder is not known. There are at least 100 cases reported in the scientific literature. Frontonasal dysplasia is usually diagnosed shortly after birth (neonatal period). Confirmation of the diagnosis typically includes a thorough clinical evaluation, specialized tests including x-ray studies, and the identification of characteristic physical features. Genetic testing for frontonasal dysplasia is available on a research basis only.', 'The exact cause of Wyburn-Mason syndrome is unknown. It is considered a developmental abnormality characterized by arteriovenous malformations. No specific genetic abnormality or hereditary tendencies have been identified. The specific, underlying mechanism(s) that cause the vascular malformations in Wyburn-Mason syndrome are not known. However, they are thought to result from abnormalities of blood vessel development during embryonic or fetal growth. Wyburn-Mason syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The incidence or prevalence rates of Wyburn-Mason syndrome in the general population are unknown. A diagnosis of Wyburn-Mason syndrome may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings, especially ocular findings. Imaging studies such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed to detect potentially dangerous central nervous system (CNS) malformations. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs such as the brain.', 'The exact cause of Madelung’s disease is not known. The body’s inability to properly metabolize fat indicates that it may be an endocrine disorder. Some scientists believe a predisposition to the disorder may be inherited and there have been some reports of cases that appear to be familial. However, the mode of transmission in those cases has not been determined. Madelung’s disease most frequently affects middle-aged males. The condition is most common in those who abuse alcohol. However, this disease is also found in women and persons who do not consume alcohol. For reasons that are unclear, the disorder appears to be more prevalent in Europe than in the United States. The diagnosis of Madelung’s disease may involve ultrasound images, CAT scans, or magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) refers to a group of rare, inherited disorders characterized by abnormal enamel formation. The term is typically restricted to those disorders of enamel development not associated with other abnormalities of the body. AI affects 1 of 14,000 to 16,000 children in the United States. Of this number, about 40% have the hypocalcified dominant type. The autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder affect males and females in equal numbers. The X-linked dominant type of the disorder affects twice as many males as females. The X-linked recessive type affects only males. Diagnosis of AI is usually made by visual examination, family history and X-ray examination at the time teeth erupt. The dentist may use a simple hand instrument to distinguish the different types of AI. By one to two years of age, the diagnosis can be made.', "Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a complex autoimmune disorder much like the more common celiac disease but, unlike celiac disease, it is resistant or unresponsive to at least 12 months of treatment with a strict gluten-free diet. Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma. Treatment involving other immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, enteric-coated budesonide, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), or inflixamab has been used with a limited number of patients.  More recently chemotherapy with cladribine with or without autologous stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be useful.", 'Relapsing polychondritis affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms usually begin between forty and sixty years of age.', 'AEC syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. AEC syndrome is a rare disorder and fewer than 100 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature.', 'MSA appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. The peak onset of MSA is between 55-60 years of age, with a range from 30 to over 90 years. The incidence of MSA in the United States is estimated at 0.6 cases per 100,000 people per year in the general population giving a current estimate of about 1,900 new cases per year in the USA. A prevalence study in London, UK, gave an age-adjusted figure of 4.4 living cases per 100,000 population at any one time, which would currently translate to about 14,000 living cases in the USA. There is about 1 living case of MSA in the population for every 40 cases of Parkinson’s disease, but because survival in MSA is shorter than for PD, about 1 new MSA case presents every year for about every 20 who present with PD.', 'A diagnosis of African iron overload is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests such as blood tests, which can reveal elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body’s iron stores. Another test measures transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a protein involved in the transport of iron from the intestine into the bloodstream.', 'Antithrombin deficiency is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Type I antithrombin deficiency is the most common subtype and is thought to occur in about one in every 3,000 to 5,000 people in the United States and is not limited to any particular ethnic group. It is estimated that approximately 1 percent of people who have venous thrombosis and embolism have congenital antithrombin deficiency. The acquired form of antithrombin deficiency is more prevalent than the congenital form of the disorder. A low blood level of antithrombin suggests that the patient may have antithrombin deficiency. However, it is important to keep in mind that many conditions can lower antithrombin levels (acute clots, heparin therapy, liver or kidney disease, etc.) without the patient having inherited antithrombin deficiency. Repeat testing should be done at a time when the patient is not ill, is not on heparin and does not have related medical problems.', 'Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease caused by any one of several thread-like parasitic round worms. The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).', 'Peutz Jeghers syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and can occur in any racial or ethnic group. The birth prevalence of PJS is estimated to be between 1/50,000 and 1/200,000. Limited evidence shows that the disease might be more prevalent in certain countries such as the Netherlands and China. Women are at a higher risk of developing cancer compared to men, as PJS increases the likelihood of developing breast, ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancer.\n', 'Acquired aplastic anemia affects males and females in about equal numbers. Most cases affect older children, teenagers or young adults. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two new cases among 1 million people per year. The incidence rate is two or three times greater in Asia. The exact incidence rates exist for the United States is unknown although some sources say that approximately 500-1,000 new cases of aplastic anemia are diagnosed each year. A diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia may be suspected when an otherwise healthy individual has low levels of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, including a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small specimen of bone marrow tissue is surgically removed, usually from the hip or pelvis, and studied under a microscope. In acquired aplastic anemia this sample will show a dramatic reduction or complete lack of cells. Additional tests may be necessary to rule out other disorders such as leukemia and to determine if there is an inherited or genetic cause.', 'The true cause behind MDD is still unknown.  MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended.  It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient’s symptoms.', 'Becker muscular dystrophy is in the category of inherited muscle wasting diseases caused by a gene abnormality (mutation) that results in deficient or abnormal production of the dystrophin protein (dystrophinopathies). The abnormal gene is called DMD and is located on the X chromosome. Becker muscular dystrophy follows x-linked recessive inheritance so it mostly affects males, but some females are affected. Becker muscular dystrophy usually begins in the teens or early twenties and symptoms vary greatly between affected individuals. Muscle deterioration progresses slowly but usually results in the need for a wheel chair. Muscles of the heart deteriorate (cardiomyopathy) in some affected individuals, and this process can become life-threatening. Learning disabilities involving visual abilities may be present. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births. The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy is based on physical symptoms, family history, an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicating destruction of muscle, and molecular genetic testing. DMD is the only gene that has been associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and many different types of DMD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition. Identification of a DMD gene mutation from molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. If molecular genetic testing is performed and a DMD gene mutation is not found, a skeletal muscle biopsy is recommended to examine the appearance of the dystrophin protein.', 'Mixed connective tissue disease may be diagnosed based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as blood tests that reveal abnormally high levels of antibodies to the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP).', 'Seborrheic Keratosis is a skin disorder usually characterized by discolored lesions that appear to be "stuck on" the skin surface. Warts may appear and skin is often oily or greasy. These skin lesions are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths and tend to appear predominately during middle age. Itching, irritation, inflammations or unsightliness of lesions may require surgical removal of affected skin areas. Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratosis are limited to discolored skin lesions that appear to be “stuck on” the skin surface.  These patches may appear suddenly, may vary in size, and tend to grow slowly.  They may be round or oval-shaped, and vary in color from tan, yellowish-brown to black.  They may be widespread over the trunk, back, and/or shoulders.  Some may be large enough to be called “giants” while others may be limited to small areas of the temples or cheeks.  The skin lesions may also be waxy, scaling or crusted.  They tend to become darker and larger with age. The exact cause of Seborrheic Keratosis is not known although researchers believe some forms may be inherited as a dominant trait.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the normal gene and resulting in appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.) Seborrheic Keratosis predominately affects middle aged individuals, although in very rare cases, it can be present at birth. Since Seborrheic Keratosis is not a form of skin cancer, treatment is not essential and removal of lesions is usually performed only to enhance comfort and/or cosmetic appearance. Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis consists of removal of the skin lesions by scraping (curettage), sealing off blood vessels or destruction of lesions (electrodessication) with local anesthetic, shave excision, or freezing with CO2 snow or liquid nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid may be used to eliminate lesions. Dermabrasion removal may also be performed. In most cases, scarring is not associated with removal of these skin lesions.', 'There are numerous conditions characterized by signs and symptoms that are similar to those found in arachnoiditis, however, only a few will be listed. They include the failed back surgery syndrome, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, chronic pain syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, syringomyelia, and some spinal cord tumors. In many cases, certain conditions can arise as complications of arachnoiditis, further rendering the diagnosis, more complex. Occasionally, the symptoms manifested by some individuals with arachnoiditis may be dismissed as psychosomatic and these patients may be branded as “pain is in your head” cases.', 'The four major features that are characteristic symptoms of BPES are present at birth: narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), formation of an upward fold of the inner lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus) and increased distance between the eyes (telecanthus). There are two types of BPES, BPES type I and type II, which are both characterized by the typical eyelid malformation. However, BPES type I is also associated with loss of ovarian function or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Menstrual periods in women with POI become less frequent over time and stop before the age of 40 thus leading to either difficulty (subfertility) or inability to conceive (infertility).  Other minor facial features frequently observed in both types include “lazy” eye (amblyopia), crossed eyes (strabismus), low-set ears, a short distance between the upper lip and nose, and a broad nasal bridge. The prevalence of BPES is unknown, but there are no differences in prevalence based on ethnicity, sex, race or age.', 'Since ring chromosome 4 was originally described, approximately 40 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. Males and females appear to be affected relatively equally.', 'HBOC syndrome can affect both men and women and occurs in people from all ethnic and racial backgrounds. In fact, HBOC syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in all ethnic and racial backgrounds. The prevalence, which is the number of people with a disorder at a given time, is not known, but estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 200 to 1 in 800 people in the general population. In certain populations, the prevalence is higher. In individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, HBOC syndrome affects about 1 in 40 people. Sometimes, this is due to a founder effect. A founder effect is when a small, isolated population of people expands over several generations leading to a high prevalence of a genetic trait.', 'Myotonia congenita is a rare genetic disorder in which an abnormality of voluntary (skeletal) muscle fiber membranes causes an unusually exaggerated response to stimulation (hyperexcitability). As a result, affected individuals have difficulty relaxing certain muscles after contracting them (myotonia), muscle stiffness (rigidity), and associated symptoms. Such symptoms tend to occur when attempting to move certain muscles after rest. In many cases, individuals with myotonia congenita also have abnormal enlargement of the muscles (hypertrophy), resulting in a "herculean" or "body-builder like" appearance.', 'AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of slowly-progressing neurodegenerative disorders that generally present with global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired/absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor symptoms. The conditions included in this group are SPG47, SPG50, SPG51 and SPG52 and all have similar symptoms. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are caused by mutations in genes that result in production of an abnormal adaptor protein complex 4. Since many of the initial clinical manifestations of SPG47 are nonspecific and may resemble other disorders characterized by spasticity, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and seizures, the diagnosis is often only made after further diagnostic testing. This may include a brain MRI showing characteristic features such as a thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles and changes in the white matter. A definitive diagnosis is reached by genetic testing.', 'Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.', 'Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking.  It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families.  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States. Imaging studies, typically computerized tomography (CT) and abdominal ultrasonography (USG), are used in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Blood and urine testing may also be helpful.', 'Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a group of related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). Lymphomas are cancer of white blood cells (lymphocytes) and can be divided depending on the type of cells, B-lymphocytes (B-cells) or T-lymphocytes (T-cells), AITL is a T-cell lymphoma. The lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream.', 'ECD is a rare disorder of adulthood that most frequently becomes apparent in middle age, with an average age of onset in the mid-50s. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature with a slight male preponderance. ECD is named for the two investigators who originally described the disease.', 'Paget’s disease is rarely diagnosed in people under the age of 40 years but may occur in up to eight percent of the population over the age of 60 years. Paget’s disease affects individuals of all ethnic and racial groups. However, it affects individuals of Asian descent less frequently. Both men and women are affected with a slight male predominance. The prevalence of Paget’s disease in the United States is estimated to be 1-2 percent of the general population. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests. A blood test may reveal elevated levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase suggesting the diagnosis of Paget’s disease. A bone scan or x-ray may also be used to determine abnormalities in the bones. Urine tests, such as pyrilinks and osteomark, may also be used to assist in the diagnosis of Paget’s disease.', 'Acrodysostosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is present at birth (congenital) but may not be apparent until years after birth. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because many cases can go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of acrodysostosis in the general population is difficult.', 'Heterozygous OSMED (oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations resulting in shortening of the upper limbs and thighs and short stature (rhizomelic dwarfism). Additional symptoms include distinctive facial features and delays in psychomotor development. After the initial period of growth deficiency, affected individuals experience gradual improvement in bone growth that leads to normal physical development by early childhood. Mental and motor development is also normal by early childhood. In some cases, affected individuals develop hearing loss. Heterozygous OSMED occurs because of disruptions or changes (mutations) to the COL11A2 gene. A diagnosis of heterozygous OSMED is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests including x-rays. X-ray studies reveal characteristic skeletal malformations associated with heterozygous OSMED.', 'Appendiceal cancer is very rare with approximately 1-2 cases per 1 million individuals. Appendiceal cancers can occur at any age, with the peak occurrence in the 6th decade (average age of 50 at diagnosis). Most studies report that men and women are affected in equal numbers, while a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers. Goblet cell carcinoid tumors tend to be easier to identify because of the unique combination of neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.', 'Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is a very rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. However, females who carry a single copy of the disease gene (heterozygous carriers) may exhibit some symptoms associated with the disorder (i.e., hemolytic anemia). The disorder can be diagnosed at birth when enzymatic testing is done. More than 30 cases of PGK deficiency have been written up in the medical literature. It is thought that there are people with the disease who do not receive a diagnosis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a thorough physical examination and confirmed by the results of laboratory tests.', 'Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome is similar to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but is short of meeting the classic criteria. See Clinical Testing for more information.', "Bacterial Meningitis is a central nervous system disease caused by certain types of bacteria. Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Inflammation can begin suddenly (acute) or develop gradually (subacute). Major symptoms may include fever, headache, and a stiff neck, sometimes with aching muscles. Nausea, vomiting and other symptoms may occur. In the United States, approximately 2,600 sporadic cases of Bacterial Meningitis are reported each year.  Meningitis caused by pneumococcal infections affects about 1.1 in 100,000 individuals.  Meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza affects about .2 in 100,000 individuals.  About 70 percent of all Bacterial Meningitis occurs in children aged 5 and under.  Children under age 2 are at highest risk for infection, and males are affected more often than females.  Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.   Bacterial Meningitis caused by pneumococcus bacteria occurs most often in adults, but there are an estimated 1,400 cases of pneumococcal meningitis each year among children under age five. Testing for Bacterial Meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or MR imaging. Other testing may include examination of the patient's blood and/or skin. Diagnosis is made by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid.", 'Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of humans caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.  For many years, it was considered a mysterious disorder associated with some type of curse, and persons with the disease were isolated and ostracized. Today, there is effective treatment and the disease can be cured. There is no longer any justification for isolating persons with leprosy. There are no closely related diseases. The diagnosis can usually be made by the history and characteristic findings on examination. The important findings are decreased ability to feel light touch in a skin spot, enlarged or tender nerves in the arms or legs, numbness in a hand or foot, and finding the bacteria in the skin. There may also be loss of hair in the affected skin areas. A special type of skin smear is commonly done and will demonstrate the bacteria in the skin in lepromatous and borderline lepromatous cases. The bacteria are too few in tuberculoid cases to be found in a skin smear. A skin biopsy of a lesion can also be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. There are no blood tests or skin tests at the present time that are helpful in the diagnosis.', 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epilepsy that typically becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected children experience several different types of seizures most commonly atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also develop cognitive dysfunction, delays in reaching developmental milestones and behavioral problems. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, but in some cases no cause can be identified. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be difficult to treat because it is resistant (refractory) to many kinds of antiseizure medications. Research is ongoing to identify and assess new therapies for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome affects males slightly more often than females. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is estimated to occur in .1-.28 people per 100,000 and is believed to account for 1-4 percent of all cases of childhood epilepsy. The annual incidence in children is estimated to be 2 per 100,000 children. Onset of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is usually between 2-7 years with a peak onset between 3 to 5 years.', 'Adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are extremely rare disorders. The prevalence is estimated to be about 1.5 people per 9,000,000 in the general population. Prevalence is the total numbers of individuals with a disease at a given time. Studies into the incidence of ANCL have varied based on the country conducting the study. Estimates range from 1.5-7 infants per 100,000 live births. Incidence is the number of new people born with a disorder in a given year.', 'Ahumada-Del Castillo is a rare endocrine disorder affecting adult females, which is characterized by impairment in the function of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  In all cases, an over-secretion of the milk-producing hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) results in the symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo. Ahumada-Del Castillo affects only females. The symptoms usually begin during adulthood.', 'Carpenter syndrome belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as “acrocephalopolysyndactyly” (ACPS) disorders. All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). Carpenter syndrome is also known as ACPS type II. Carpenter syndrome appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. More than 70 cases of the disorder have been recorded. In 10 patients that had sequence analysis for the disease causing gene, homozygosity (two copies) for the same nonsense mutation, (a change in the DNA that causes a change in the protein) was found. This is indicative of a founder effect in patients of northern European descent, which means that a high prevalence of a genetic disorder in an isolated or inbred population is due to the fact that many members of the population are derived from a common ancestor who had the disease causing mutation.', 'ASAH1-related disorders are extremely rare disorders. They affect males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 200 individuals have been described in the medical literature. However, rare disorders like ASAH1-related disorders often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. acid ceramidase deficiency', 'Hairy tongue is an uncommon, benign condition that is also known as black hairy tongue or lingua nigra. It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or "staining" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue\'s surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue\'s surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal “shedding” (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician\'s direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.', 'Primary distal renal tubular acidosis affects females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. Rare disorders like primary distal renal tubular acidosis often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population.', 'Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare spinal disorder that results from an injury to one side of the spinal cord in which the spinal cord is damaged but is not severed completely. It is usually caused by an injury to the spine in the region of the neck or back. In many cases, affected individuals have received some type of puncture wound in the neck or in the back that damages the spine and causes symptoms to appear. Brown-Séquard syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 500 cases have been reported to date. The incidence of Brown-Séquard syndrome has been estimated to be 2% of all traumatic spinal cord injuries. The annual incidence of all forms of spinal cord injury is estimated to be 30-40 per 1,000,000 people.', 'VACTERL with hydrocephalus is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which the multisystem features of VACTERL association occur in addition to hydrocephalus. The term VACTERL is an acronym with each letter representing the first letter of the more common findings seen in affected children: VACTERL with hydrocephalus is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. A diagnosis may be made based upon a complete physical exam and a variety of specialized tests to look for the major and minor features of VACTERL association occurring along with hydrocephalus.', 'Horner syndrome is a relatively rare disorder characterized by a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), absence of sweating of the face (anhidrosis), and sinking of the eyeball into the bony cavity that protects the eye (enophthalmos). These are the four classic signs of the disorder. Horner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and may occur at any age, among any ethnic grouping in any geographic location. The diagnosis of Horner syndrome and the localization of the lesions that cause the disorder can be determined by pharmacological tests combined with imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography of the carotid artery.', 'Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by involuntary and abnormal movements of the jaw, lips and tongue. Typical symptoms include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, sucking or fish-like movements of the mouth. In some cases, the arms and/or legs may also be affected by involuntary rapid, jerking movements (chorea), or slow, writhing movements (athetosis). Symptoms of tardive dystonia include slower, twisting movements of larger muscles of the neck and trunk as well as the face. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by long-term use of a class of drugs known as neuroleptics. Neuroleptic drugs are often prescribed for management of certain mental, neurological, or gastrointestinal disorders. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are drugs used for chronic gastrointestinal conditions that may cause tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic drugs block dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is a chemical that helps brain cells to communicate. Although most cases occur after a person has taken these drugs for several years, some cases may occur with shorter use of neuroleptic drugs. Tardive dyskinesia affects individuals who have been taking neuroleptic drugs for a long period of time. A high percentage of schizophrenic people who have spent long periods of time taking these drugs have a high risk of developing TD. However, neuroleptic drugs are also prescribed for depression, some digestive disorders, and other neurologic illnesses.', 'Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that is rare in the United States but common in some other parts of the world. It primarily affects children between the ages of 6 and 16, and develops after an infection with streptococcal bacteria, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. About 5% of those with untreated strep infection will develop rheumatic fever. Although rheumatic fever is clearly linked to Group A streptococcal infections (strep throat), the exact mechanism causing the disorder is not well understood.  Strep throat is highly contagious, whereas rheumatic fever is not contagious.  People who have had rheumatic fever tend to develop flare-ups with repeated strep infections.', 'VWS is the most common single gene cause of cleft lip and palate. The prevalence is in the range of 1/35,000-1/100,000 in Europe and Asia. The prevalence of PPS is approximately 1/300,000.', 'BRAF Currently, there is no study providing an accurate estimate of the population prevalence of CFC syndrome. However one study in Japan, reported the incidence to be approximately 1 in 810,000. It is thought that males and females are affected equally. There are patients are reported from all continents. The number of affected individuals reported in the medical literature is now close to 400 and the total number worldwide is estimated to be more than this. This may be an underestimate, however, because mildly affected adults may go undiagnosed.', "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare acquired neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness (rigidity) and repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms. Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS. High doses of diazepam will suppress the characteristic EMG results.", 'Common symptoms of PDCD may initially be poor feeding, lethargy and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in an infant. Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may reveal structural brain abnormalities associated with severe disease. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating abnormal PDC enzyme levels or function in leukocytes, fibroblasts or from a tissue biopsy.', 'Summary  Males and females have an equal chance of developing Dubowitz syndrome. It can happen in people of all ethnicities and races. There are between 150 and 200 cases recorded in research articles, but researchers believe that there are more people with Dubowitz syndrome who have not been diagnosed.', 'Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL) is a rare developmental disorder that is present at birth (congenital). Affected infants have abnormally widened (dilated) lymphatic vessels within the lungs. The lymphatic system helps the immune system in protecting the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. According to some reports CPL occurs more often in males than females. However, the data is not conclusive and CPL may occur in males and females in equal numbers. The exact number of cases of CPL is unknown. In the past, the disorder was associated with high mortality in the newborn period. CPL was first described in the medical literature in 1856.', 'Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare disorder characterized by partial or complete absence of the stomach (abdominal) muscles, failure of both testes to descend into the scrotum (bilateral cryptorchidism), and/or urinary tract malformations. The urinary malformations may include abnormal widening (dilation) of the tubes that bring urine to the bladder (ureters), accumulation of urine in the ureters (hydroureter) and the kidneys (hydronephrosis), and/or backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Complications associated with Prune-Belly syndrome may include underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) and/or chronic renal failure. The exact cause of Prune-Belly syndrome is not known. Prune Belly syndrome is a very rare disorder that is present at birth.  The disorder affects mostly males but a few female cases have been described in the medical literature. The diagnosis is usually obvious from birth, but care and time are required to determine the location and number of abnormalities. A full understanding of the complications will involve imaging tests such as ultrasound, X-ray, and, in order to determine the extent of involvement of the genitourinary tract, intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP makes use of a dye to map the degree of involvement of the kidneys and their ducts.', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis type I affects males and females in equal numbers, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live births for the severe type, and an incidence of about 1in 500,000 live births for the attenuated type. Incidence is the number of people who develop a disorder over a given period of time (e.g. one year). The incidence for MPS disorders collectively is about 1 in 25,000. However, rare disorders, especially milder forms of MPS, often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.', 'Fetal retinoid syndrome is a pattern of mental and physical birth defects (congenital malformations) that can result from a mother taking retinoids during pregnancy. The absolute risk of congenital malformations following oral isotretinoin therapy is currently unclear. Overall malformation rates in live-born infants from prospectively reported pregnancies range from 5% to 20%. Fetal retinoid syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of fetal retinoid syndrome is unknown and because many children with fetal retinoid syndrome often go unrecognized. The disorder is under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.', 'Grover\'s disease is a rare, transient skin disorder that consists of small, firm, raised red lesions, most often on the skin of the chest and back. Diagnosis of this disorder becomes apparent under microscopic examination when the loss of the "cement" that holds the skin cells together is observed. Over time, as the skin loses the "cement", the cells separate (lysis). Small blisters containing a watery liquid are present. These blisters tend to group and have a swollen red border around them. Grover\'s disease is mainly seen in males older than forty or fifty. Its cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to trauma to sun damaged skin. The exact cause of Grover’s disease is not known.  It may be related to fragility of old sun-damaged skin.  Some doctors feel that this skin disorder may be related to heat and sweating.  There have been multiple cases of this disorder associated with such things as hot tubs, hot water bottles, electric blankets, steam baths and prolonged confinement to a bed.  This theory has not been proven.  At least one case of this disorder has been associated with follicle mites which are parasites. Grover’s disease is a rare skin disorder seen mainly in males over the age of forty or fifty.  It has also been found in females.', 'The component features of OMS include repeated, random and rapid eye movements in both horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions (opsoclonus); unsteady gait or loss of ability to stand and walk (ataxia); brief, repeated, shock-like spasms of several muscles within the arms, legs (myoclonus), or tremor interfering with hand use. Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated ‘idiopathic’ or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 – 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the ‘dancing eyes’, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called “MS panel”, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.\n', 'To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. Off label prescription of biphosphanates have been reported in few patients (Loeb et al., 1998, 2006, Oliveira & Oliveira, 2017).', 'Cone dystrophy is a general term used to describe a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature. Most sources estimate the incidence as approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population. Cone dystrophy is usually present in early infancy or during childhood or early adulthood. However, the disorder has been reported to develop in individuals of all ages including older adults.', 'X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle disease (myopathy). The disorder is fully expressed in males only and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs. Onset is usually during childhood often between 5-10 years of age. XMEA occurs due to mutations of an unidentified gene on the X chromosome. The disorder is inherited an X-linked recessive trait. A diagnosis of XMEA is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and surgical removal and microscopic evaluation (biopsy) of affected muscle tissue.', 'Males and females are affected in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown, but spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 live births. Collectively, the skeletal dysplasias are estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals in the general population.', 'Erythromelalgia is a rare condition that primarily affects the feet and, less commonly, the hands (extremities). It is characterized by intense, burning pain of affected extremities, severe redness (erythema), and increased skin temperature that may be episodic or almost continuous in nature. (The prefix "erythro-" denotes redness, "mel-" is a combining form meaning limb or limbs, and the suffix "-algia" indicates pain.) Although erythromelalgia typically affects both sides of the body (bilateral), it may sometimes involve only one side (unilateral). The disease course may be extremely variable from case to case.', 'Dermatomyositis may occur at any time from infancy through approximately age 80, but most commonly it occurs between ages 40 to 60. The estimated incidence of dermatomyositis is 9.63 cases per million people. In children, the symptoms usually appear between the ages of five to 15 years. Approximately three in 1,000,000 children are affected by juvenile dermatomyositis. Females are affected by dermatomyositis twice as often as males.', 'Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a rare neuromuscular disorder.  An important clinical symptomatic feature is the presence of a mono-or bilateral ptosis (partial closure of the eyelids). This disease is mostly characterized by three primary findings: progressive paralysis of certain eye muscles (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [CPEO]); abnormal accumulation of colored (pigmented) material on the nerve-rich membrane lining the eyes (atypical retinitis pigmentosa), leading to chronic inflammation, progressive degeneration, and wearing-away of certain eye structures (pigmentary degeneration of the retina); and heart disease (cardiomyopathy) such as heart block. Other findings may include muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, and/or the loss of ability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia) due to problems affecting part of the brain (cerebellum). In some cases, KSS may be associated with other disorders and/or conditions.', 'Chromosome 22 Ring is a rare disorder characterized by abnormalities of the 22nd chromosome. Associated symptoms and findings may be extremely variable from case to case. However, the disorder is typically associated with moderate to severe mental retardation. Some affected individuals may also have relatively mild, nonspecific physical (i.e., dysplastic) features, whereas others may have more distinctive, potentially severe physical abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, common findings include diminished muscle tone (hypotonia) and motor incoordination; an unsteady manner of walking (gait); pronounced verbal delays; and/or certain malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such craniofacial abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly); vertical skin folds that may cover the eyes\' inner corners (epicanthal folds); unusually large ears; and/or other malformations. Chromosome 22 Ring is usually caused by spontaneous or "de novo" errors very early in the development of the embryo that appear to occur randomly for unknown reasons. Based upon observed cases, Chromosome 22 Ring has appeared to affect females more frequently than males.  Over 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.', 'A diagnosis of coronal dentin dysplasia is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. X-rays may reveal abnormal coronal pulp formation, obliteration of the pulp chambers, pulp stones or thistle-shaped deformity of the pulp chamber.', 'Pneumocystis pneumonia is characterized by a gradual onset with shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect β-D-glucan is used.', 'Diamond Blackfan anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 people per million live births per year. Thus in the United States, with 4 million livebirths per year, there are approximately 25-35 new patients born per year. There are several approximately 5000 cases world-wide. There are an equal number of males and females with the disease.', 'A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the muscle at the base of the lungs (diaphragm) followed by the rapid closure of the vocal cords. Usually, hiccups last for a few hours or, occasionally, a day or two. However, chronic hiccups are ones that continue for an extended period of time. Episodes that last for more than two days and less than a month are sometimes called persistent hiccups. On rare occasions, hiccups persist even longer than a month or recur frequently over an extended period of time. The longest recorded episode of these chronic hiccups lasted 60 years. Hiccups are unmistakable, and rarely taken for anything else.  They often start for no apparent reason, and usually go away on their own in a few minutes.  Of concern is the period of time required for an episode to run its course.   Hiccups that persist over a period of time may cause exhaustion and weight loss from lack of sleep and the interruption of normal eating patterns. Hiccups affect males more often than females.  Hiccups occur in practically every human being, but chronic hiccups are very rare. There are many disorders involving the autonomic nervous system which controls unconscious activities of the body such as breathing, sweating, heartbeat, hiccups, coughing, etc. The diagnosis of chronic hiccups may be obvious, but blood, imaging, and other laboratory studies may be used to determine the underlying cause.', 'Cyclic vomiting syndrome affects females somewhat more often than males (55:45). It most commonly occurs in children between the ages of three and seven, although it can begin at any age, from early infancy through to old age (73 is the oldest). Because it is not recognized or misdiagnoses as stomach flu, a correct diagnosis is often delayed for many years. Although CVS is found more often in children, it is being recognized with greater frequency in adults. The incidence of CVS is unknown, although it is not rare. Two studies in Scotland and Australia have suggested that as many as 2% of all Caucasian school-aged children suffer from CVS. However, researchers believe the disorder is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to estimate its true frequency in the general population. CVS was first described in the medical literature in 1806 in French, and 1882 in English. A diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee. The determination of CVS can only be made after other causes of recurrent vomiting have been ruled out. There is no “test” to prove the presence of cyclic vomiting syndrome, although the presence of urine ketosis early in an episode may be helpful. A variety of tests of may be used to rule out other, more common, causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting, including an upper gastrointestinal radiograph.', 'MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome is a rare disorder that begins in childhood, usually between two and fifteen years of age, and mostly affects the nervous system and muscles. The most common early symptoms are seizures, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting. Stroke-like episodes with temporary muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis) may also occur and this can lead to altered consciousness, vision and hearing loss, loss of motor skills and intellectual disability. MELAS is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and in one patient, this syndrome has been associated with mutations in a nuclear gene, POLG1. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Although rare, MELAS syndrome is probably the most common type of mitochondrial myopathy caused by mutations in mtDNA. Some researchers believe that mitochondrial myopathies may go unrecognized and underdiagnosed in the general population, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of disorders like MELAS syndrome.', 'The diagnosis of progressive osseous heteroplasia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, characteristic physical findings, and tests that demonstrate the presence of heterotopic ossification (e.g., x-ray and roentgenograms) with characteristic appearance for POH. An additional test may include the removal and testing of tissues (biopsy). In some cases, there may be temporarily (transient) increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood serum.', 'Ventricular septal defects are heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). The normal heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a fibrous partition known as the atrial septum. The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The aorta, the main vessel of arterial circulation, carries blood from the left ventricle and away from the heart. The exact cause of VSDs is not known. These defects probably occur as the result of errors in the development of an embryo. During the early part of fetal development there is no wall (septum) to separate the left and right ventricles. As the fetus grows, so does a muscular wall that splits the lower chamber into two ventricles.  If the muscle does not form a solid wall, a hole remains and is what is called the ventricular septal defect. The why and how of these developmental errors is not fully understood. However, research suggests that they may occur as the result of the complex interaction of many factors, both genetic and environmental (multifactorial).', 'Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population.  Both the syphilitic and non-syphilitic forms of chronic PCH are exceedingly rare.  The prevalence and incidence rates are unknown.   Anyone may acquire PCH, but it is more common among children than among adults. An individual with a viral infection is at higher risk of contracting the disorder. No known genetic, sex, or racial risk factors exist, although the disease has been reported in families. A diagnosis of PCH may be suspected in some individuals with anemia. In particular, the diagnosis should be suspected in any acutely ill child with hemoglobinuria. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of specialized tests such as a direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) test, which is used to detect certain antibodies that act against red blood cells. A diagnosis of PCH is confirmed by the results of a Donath-Landsteiner test, which can distinguish PCH from other forms of hemolytic anemia. The test consists of incubating a sample of the patient’s serum with normal red blood cells (RBCs) in the cold for 30 minutes and then warming the mixture to body temperature (37C). Hemolysis of the RBCs in this "bi-phasic" test indicates a diagnosis of PCH.', 'Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract causing gastrointestinal dysmotility, weakness of extra-ocular muscles causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and restricted eye movements (ophthalmoparesis), degeneration of peripheral nerves causing altered sensation and weakness the distal arms and legs, and general wasting (cachexia). The specific symptoms associated with MNGIE vary from case to case and may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and numbness or sensations of pins and needles in the hands and feet. . Additional findings may occur in some cases. MNGIE is caused by changes (mutations) in the TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.', 'Crigler-Najjar syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 750,000-1,000,000 people in the general population. Many researchers believe that the disorder often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. It is likely more common than estimated.', 'Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a rare disorder that affects women. It is characterized by the failure of the uterus and the vagina to develop properly in women who have normal ovarian function and normal external genitalia. Women with this disorder develop normal secondary sexual characteristics during puberty (e.g., breast development and pubic hair), but do not have a menstrual cycle (primary amenorrhea). Often, the failure to begin the menstrual cycle is the initial clinical sign of MRKH syndrome. The range and severity of MRKH syndrome can vary greatly and the disorder is generally broken down into type I, which occurs as an isolated finding, and type II, which occurs with abnormalities of additional organ systems including mainly the kidneys and the skeleton. Because of the nature of the disorder, MRKH syndrome can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended. The exact cause of MRKH syndrome remains largely unknown, but there is now no doubt of a genetic origin. In this respect, an update on the most recent research publications shows the involvement of several chromosomal segments, some of them including genes likely to account for the disorder.', 'UCD and iMCD affect males and females in equal numbers, and there are no known factors that increase the risk of UCD or iMCD. HHV-8-associated MCD affects males at an increased rate compared to females. All types of Castleman disease may affect individuals of any age. Persons with HIV are at increased risk of developing HHV-8-associated MCD. It is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 individuals diagnosed each year and 30,000 individuals in the United States afflicted with one of the forms of Castleman disease.', 'Trisomy 5p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 5 (5p) appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. Often the duplicated portion of 5p (trisomy) is due to a complex rearrangement involving other chromosomes. These individuals have a variable phenotype depending on which chromosome is involved, the size of the duplication and whether there is loss of material from the same or another chromosome. In observed cases, trisomy 5p has appeared to affect females slightly more often than males and affects all ethnic groups. More than 40 cases have been described since the original description by Lejeune in 1964. While the features for trisomy 5p appear consistent, the diagnosis cannot be made on clinical features alone. Many of the features seen in trisomy 5p can be seen in other genetic conditions or chromosomal abnormalities. (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'The severity of GAMT varies from patient to patient. Global developmental delays affect all individuals with this disorder and may be the first sign, appearing before other symptoms.The majority of individuals with GAMT deficiency have intellectual disabilities, seizure disorders, muscle weakness, behavior disorders, and movement disorders. People with GAMT may have weak muscle tone and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting or walking. Severely affected patients may lose previously acquired skills such as the ability to support their head or to sit unsupported. The prevalence of GAMT deficiency has been estimated to be from 1 out of 2,640,000 to 1 out of 550,000 patients being diagnosed to a conflicting report of 1 out of 115,000 patients being diagnosed.  As of 2015, there have only been 110 individuals with GAMT deficiency diagnosed worldwide. GAMT deficiency patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.', 'Isovaleric Acidemia is a hereditary metabolic disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy. Isovaleric Acidemia is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers, usually beginning during infancy.', 'CHARGE syndrome is a rare disorder, affecting 0.1-1.2/10,000 live births. It affects males and females in equal numbers and has been seen in all races and on every continent. There are far more cases of CHARGE than those described in the medical literature. Many cases are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, especially in children with fewer problems. Although many features of CHARGE are apparent at birth, some features will not become apparent for weeks, months, or perhaps years later. The recurrence risk of CHARGE for parents with one affected child is low, around 2-3 percent. The recurrence risk for an adult with CHARGE to have an affected child may be as high as 50 percent.', 'Trisomy X is a chromosomal disorder that affects only females. Reported estimates of frequency have varied with the most common estimate being one in 1,000 female births. Because many females with the disorder may have few or no symptoms, they may never be diagnosed. Researchers believe that the disorder is underdiagnosed and that the reported number of affected females as reflected in the medical literature is inappropriately low. Researchers believe that only approximately 10 percent of affected individuals are diagnosed. With increased detection, more in depth studies may be conducted and more girls with trisomy X can be appropriately treated.', 'Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion (monosomy) of a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7 (7p). Associated symptoms and findings may be variable and may depend on the specific size and location of the deleted segment of 7p. However, in many cases, there is early closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), resulting in an abnormally shaped head. For example, depending on the specific sutures involved, the forehead may appear unusually "triangular shaped" (trigonocephaly) or the head may seem abnormally long and narrow with the top pointed or conical (turricephaly). Affected infants and children may also have additional malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region. Such abnormalities may include an unusually small head (microcephaly), closely or widely set eyes (ocular hypotelorism or hypertelorism), downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), and/or other findings. Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p is a rare chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Additional chromosomal disorders may be characterized by symptoms and findings similar to those associated with Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p.  Chromosomal testing is necessary to confirm the specific chromosomal abnormality present.  (For further information on such disorders, choose the name of the specific chromosomal disorder in question or use “chromosome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)', 'Nemaline myopathy is a rare disorder that affects males and females. The incidence is unknown although two studies (one in Finland and one in an American Ashkenazi Jewish population) estimated the incidence to be 1 in 50,000 live births. An incidence of 1/500 has been reported in the Amish community. A diagnosis of nemaline myopathy is suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient and family history and identification of characteristic findings. A diagnosis of nemaline myopathy is suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient and family history and identification of characteristic findings. A diagnosis may be confirmed by the presence of thread- or rod-like structures (nemaline bodies) on muscle biopsy when stained with Gomori trichrome. A biopsy is the surgical removal and microscopic evaluation of affected tissue. Increasingly the diagnosis is made or confirmed by molecular genetic testing for mutations in the genes known to cause nemaline myopathy.', 'PNENs seem to affect women slightly more often than men. Individuals of any ethnic or racial group may develop a pNEN. Affected individuals usually develop sporadic pNENs between the ages of 30-60. When pNENs occur as part of a genetic syndrome, they tend to occur during childhood or young adulthood. PNENs affect approximately ~1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population per year. They account for approximately 2-4 percent of all pancreatic neoplasms. A diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including advanced imaging techniques (octrotide-scintigraphy, CT, MRI, PET-CT, PET-MRI), blood tests (Chromogranin A, NETest), biochemical tests, and also biopsies.', 'Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare neuropathy that severely affects the peripheral as well as the central nervous system. The first symptoms appear in early childhood. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski’s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent’s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade. Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare disorder that presents in early childhood. This disorder affects equal numbers of males and females. The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of "giant axons" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments. Molecular genetic testing for abnormalities in the GAN gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Negative mutation screening of the region of the GAN gene which encodes the protein does not exclude the diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy.', 'Froehlich syndrome, also known as adiposogenital dystrophy, is a constellation of endocrine abnormalities believed to result from damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In addition to delayed growth and puberty, children with this syndrome tend to be short in stature. As a result of tumor growth, some children with Froehlich syndrome may also develop intellectual difficulties, poor vision – due optic nerve damage-, somnolence, and diabetes insipidus –  known as Infundibulo-tuberal syndrome (Froehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus), lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and very delicate skin. Froehlich syndrome is a very rare condition that affects more males than females.', 'Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure, the inability of the marrow to produce sufficient blood cells. Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT. In families with an increased frequency of bone marrow failure and/or lung disease, dyskeratosis congenita should be excluded as a possible cause of their disease.', 'Timothy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart and several other organs. The most obvious manifestation is the abnormally long repolarization (QT interval) in the heart that predisposes patients to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Unlike other forms of long QT syndrome, patients with Timothy syndrome also present with cardiac malformations, thickening of the cardiac walls (cardiac hypertrophy) and enlargement of the heart (cardiac dilatation). Timothy syndrome has been diagnosed in an extremely low number of individuals in the world because it has a high mortality, it is a complex disease, and few affected individuals reproduce.', 'Lowe syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 and 10 males per 1,000,000 people. This condition has been reported in North and South America, Europe, Japan, and India.', 'Fournier gangrene is an acute necrotic infection of the scrotum; penis; or perineum. It is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease. The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.', 'Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder due to a lack of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL). The defect is characterized by the appearance of two unusual chemicals, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA riboside) and succinyladenosine, in cerebrospinal fluid, in urine and, to a much smaller extent, in plasma. These compounds, which are never found in healthy individuals, are formed from the two natural compounds acted upon by the enzyme. The symptoms and the physical findings associated with ASLD vary greatly from case to case. As a rule, patients with ASLD present with a mix of neurological symptoms that usually will include some of the following: psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia, muscle wasting, and secondary feeding problems. Although abnormal physical features (dysmorphism) are not common, when they do occur they may include severe growth failure, small head circumference, brachycephaly, flat occiput, prominent metopic suture, intermittent divergent strabismus, small nose with anteverted nostrils, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, and low set ears.', 'Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the association of benign growths (adenomatous polyps) in the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract with tumors of the central nervous system. Symptoms associated with polyp formation may include diarrhea, bleeding from the end portion of the large intestine (rectum), fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Affected individuals may also experience neurological symptoms, depending upon the type, size and location of the associated brain tumor. Some researchers believe that Turcot syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis. Others believe that it is a separate disorder. The exact cause of Turcot syndrome is not known. Turcot syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature.', 'HTLV-I was first isolated in 1980 from a patient originally thought to have a cutaneous lymphoma. It became clear that it was a distinct form of lymphoma, which was designated as acute T-cell leukemia/ lymphoma (ATL). Some years later, different groups in Martinique and Japan described an association between a chronic disease of the spinal cord and HTLV-I infection, which was later named HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Since then, several other conditions have been linked to HTLV infection.', 'Major symptoms may include excessive oral tendencies with an urge to put all kinds of objects into the mouth, hypermetamorophosis (a need to explore everything), memory loss, emotional changes, extreme sexual behavior, indifference, placidity, visual distractibility and visual agnosia (difficulty identifying and processing visual information). An almost uncontrollable appetite for food may also be noted. There may also be other symptoms associated with dementia (loss of reason) as well. Klüver-Bucy syndrome is the result of damage to the temporal lobes of the brain. This may be the result of trauma to the brain itself, or the result of other degenerative brain diseases, tumors, or it can be caused by some brain infections, most commonly herpes simplex encephalitis (a viral brain infection). Klüver-Bucy syndrome is a very rare disease that affects males and females equally. Treatment of Klüver-Bucy syndrome is supportive and psychotropics that may be effective for some of the associated symptoms.', 'Atransferrinemia is an extremely rare disorder. Approximately 10 cases in 8 families have been reported in the medical literature. Because atransferrinemia may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. Atransferrinemia affects males and females in equal numbers. Atransferrinemia was first described in the medical literature in 1961. A diagnosis of atransferrinemia is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Laboratory tests can reveal low or undetectable levels of transferrin in the blood.', 'Pallister W syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unusual facial features such as clefting of the palate and the upper lip, a broad flat nose, widely spaced slanted eyes, and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Other symptoms may include mental retardation, speech problems, bone deformities of the arms and legs, and/or seizures. The exact cause of Pallister W syndrome is not known. Pallister W syndrome is apparent at birth.  It is characterized by widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) with downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad tip of the nose, a broad flat jaw, central clefting of the palate or upper lip, seizures, and mental retardation.  There may also be bone abnormalities in the arms and legs such as abnormal deviation of the elbow away from the body when the arm is extended (cubitus valgus).  Other symptoms may include hair that does not lie flat on the head (cowlick), missing teeth (partial adontia), broad uvula, and a high broad forehead.  Additional findings may include tremor and/or involuntary muscle contractions (i.e., spasticity). Pallister W syndrome is a very rare disorder.  As of  the year 2000, only six cases had been reported in the medical literature.  More than half involved male infants but the numbers are not large enough to draw any conclusions regarding whether it affects one sex more than the other. The characteristic facial features assist in the diagnosis.', 'Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare respiratory disorder in which air can enter the lungs but cannot escape, causing overinflation (hyperinflation) of the lobes of the lung. It is most often detected in newborns or young infants, but some cases do not become apparent until adulthood. This disorder may be severe enough to cause associated heart problems (15% of cases) or so mild as to never become apparent. Some cases of congenital lobar emphysema may be caused by autosomal dominant inheritance while others occur for no apparent reason (sporadic). About 50% of cases occur in the first four weeks after birth.  About 75% of cases are found in infants less than six months of age.  This disorder is more common among boys than among girls.', 'Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the failure of the prosencephalon, or forebrain, to develop normally. The forebrain is a region of the brain in the fetus that develops into parts of the adult brain, including the cerebral cortex. Instead of the normal complete separation of the left and right halves of the forebrain, there is an abnormal continuity between the two sides. There are several different types of holoprosencephaly. In the alobar form, there is no separation between the right and left halves at all. In semilobar HPE, at least some separation of the two halves is present. In the lobar form, most of the brain has separated into right and left sides, though there is incomplete division into the two halves. Holoprosencephaly affects males and females in equal numbers before birth and has been reported in many ethnic groups. The incidence of holoprosencephaly has been estimated at 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and approximately 1 in 16,000 live births.', 'BVMD is fairly common form of macular degeneration affecting about 1 in 10,000 individuals. Typical age of onset is between the ages of 5 and 10 but can occur earlier or later. BVMD occurs equally often in men and women. This condition has been diagnosed in individuals of European, African and Hispanic ancestry.', "Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is a rare genetic bone disorder (osteopathy) that usually becomes apparent during infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals develop progressive skeletal malformations especially in the long bones of the arms and legs. Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956. A diagnosis of hereditary hyperphosphatasia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms and a variety of x-rays tests that reveal distinct radiographic findings. Affected individuals also have elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and other biochemical markers of bone turnover, detectable through blood and urine tests.", 'Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is classified as a form of chondrodysplasia punctata, a group of disorders characterized by the formation of small, hardened spots of calcium on the "growing portion" or heads of the long bones (stippled epiphyses) or inside other areas of cartilage in the body. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is commonly associated with disproportionate and assymetric shortening of long bones, particularly those of the upper arms (humeri) and the thigh bones (femora), curvature of the spine and mild to moderate growth deficiency, resulting in short stature. Many affected individuals also have a prominent forehead; unusually flattened midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), with a low nasal bridge; loss of transparency of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts); sparse, coarse scalp hair; and/or abnormal thickening, dryness, and scaling of the skin. Conradi-Hünermann syndrome is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait that occurs almost exclusively in females.', 'Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by defects of the scalp and abnormalities of the fingers, toes, arms, and/or legs. The physical abnormalities associated with this disorder vary greatly among affected individuals. Some cases may be very mild while others may be severe. In infants with Adams-Oliver syndrome, scalp defects are present at birth (congenital) and may include one or multiple hairless scarred areas that may have abnormally wide (dilated) blood vessels directly under the affected skin. In severe cases, an underlying defect of the bones of the skull may also be present. In addition, infants with this disorder typically have malformations of the hands, arms, feet, and/or legs. These range from abnormally short (hypoplastic) fingers and toes to absent hands and/or lower legs. In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. Most cases of AOS appear to follow autosomal dominant inheritance but autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. Adams-Oliver syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. More than 125 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature. The major physical features of Adams-Oliver syndrome (i.e., scalp defects and limb abnormalities) are apparent at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome may be suspected at birth based upon the identification of characteristic scalp and skull defects occurring in association with malformations of the fingers, toes, hands, and/or feet. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as advanced imaging techniques. In some cases, it may be possible to detect defects of the skull and/or limbs before birth (prenatally) through the use of advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound. During fetal ultrasonography, reflected sound waves are used to create an image of the developing fetus.', 'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of blood cells called platelets, a situation which is referred to as thrombocytopenia. Platelets are specialized blood cells that help maintain the integrity of the walls of our blood vessels and help prevent and stop bleeding by accelerating clotting. A normal platelet count ranges from approximately 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter of blood depending on the laboratory. If someone has a platelet count lower than 100,000 per microliter of blood with no other reason for low platelets, that person might have ITP. There is currently no definitive laboratory test to diagnose ITP. Rather ITP is considered a diagnosis of exclusion (see below) meaning that other causes have been eliminated or are unlikely. What tests to do to exclude other causes is not well-established and can differ among patients and hematologists.', 'Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that includes a neonatal acute (classic) form, a milder late-onset form, a form that begins during or after pregnancy, and an asymptomatic form. CTLN1 occurs in approximately 1/57,000 births.', 'Gordon syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 40 people in five families (kindreds) have been reported in the medical literature. In most people, physical features associated with Gordon syndrome are obvious at birth (congenital). In most people, Gordon syndrome is diagnosed at birth by a thorough clinical evaluation and the identification of characteristic physical findings. Many of the physical features associated with Gordon syndrome (e.g., camptodactyly, clubfoot, and/or cleft palate) are obvious at birth (congenital).', "Pernicious anemia is a rare blood disorder characterized by the inability of the body to properly utilize vitamin B12, which is essential for the development of red blood cells. Most cases result from the lack of the gastric protein known as intrinsic factor, without which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed patient history and specialized laboratory tests. During a Schilling test, the intestines' ability to absorb vitamin B12 is measured. The vitamin is labeled with radioactive cobalt and is ingested by mouth. X-ray studies can then determine if the body is properly absorbing this vitamin.", 'Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare tumor of the salivary glands that is limited, to a great extent, to the minor salivary glands and commonly, but not exclusively, localized in the palate of the mouth. The major salivary glands are the parotid glands (at the side of the face, below the ears), the sublingual glands (below the tongue), and the submandibular glands (below the lower jaw).  As the name suggests, each of the major salivary glands is of substantial size and visible to the naked eye. There are about 600 to 1,000 minor salivary glands that are microscopic in size. These minor salivary glands are found in the lining (mucosa) of the lips, tongue, and hard and soft palate, as well as inside the nose, cheeks, and sinuses. A lump or mass in the palate or near any of the salivary glands should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  A lingering pain in the area of the salivary glands is a signal to see a physician.  A change in the size and/or shape of one of the salivary glands (asymmetry) may be a sufficient reason to see a doctor.  Unexplained bleeding in the mouth is also a symptom warranting attention, and any persistent numbness on any part of the face or a weakening of the muscles on one side of the face should be brought to the attention of a physician.  Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Why a normal cell becomes malignant is not yet fully understood. In most instances PLGA affects people in their middle age.  The median age at which patients are diagnosed is 57 years, with a range of from 22 to 71 years.  For reasons that are unknown, this disease affects slightly more women than men. The diagnosis of PLGA may be suspected on history and clinical examination, but can be confirmed only by biopsy of the affected tissue.', 'Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) is a brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM. The frequency of Dandy Walker malformation in the US is approximately 1 per 25,000 -35,000 live births and affects more females than males. Dandy Walker malformation is diagnosed with the use of ultrasound, CT and MRI. Prenatal diagnosis of Dandy-Walker malformation is sometimes made by ultrasound or fetal MRI.', 'Macroglossia is the abnormal enlargement of the tongue. In rare cases, macroglossia occurs as an isolated finding that is present at birth (congenital). In many cases, macroglossia may occur secondary to a primary disorder that may be either congenital (e.g., Down syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) or acquired (e.g., as a result of trauma or malignancy). Symptoms and physical findings associated with macroglossia may include noisy, high-pitched breathing (stridor), snoring, and/or feeding difficulties. In some cases, the tongue may protrude from the mouth. When inherited, macroglossia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Macroglossia is a disorder characterized by a tongue that is large in proportion to other structures in the mouth.  In the congenital type of the disorder, protrusion of the tongue from the mouth may interfere with feeding of the infant.  Later, talking may be affected.  The large size of the tongue may also cause abnormal development of the jaw and teeth, resulting in misaligned or protruding teeth.  Ulceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue may be other symptoms of the disorder. Isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia is very rare, with about 50 cases reported in the medical literature.  The prevalence in other instances depends on the underlying disorder for which the macroglossia is secondary.  For example, macroglossia occurs in most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the prevalence of that syndrome is estimated at 1 in 17,000 births. Infants born with isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia present with the obvious sign at birth. A family history and physical exam can confirm the diagnosis.', 'Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder characterized by clubbing of the fingers, thickening of the skin of the face (pachyderma), and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis). It typically appears during childhood or adolescence, often around the time of puberty, and progresses slowly for about ten years. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females with a ratio of 7:1.  This ratio may not be totally valid since females often have milder symptoms than do men, with the fibrous bone growth (periostosis) not being detected unless X-rays are taken. Diagnosis is made clinically. Major diagnostic criteria for HOA are clubbing of the fingers (digital clubbing) and fibrous bone growth (periostosis). Pachydermoperiostosis is the complete form of HOA. There are also three incomplete forms. clubbing alone, periostosis without clubbing, and pachyderma.', 'Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 is deleted (monosomic). The disorder is typically characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such features commonly include an unusually small head (microcephaly); a broad, flat nose; a "carp-shaped" mouth; large, protruding ears; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); and/or other abnormalities. Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye. Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p appears to affect females more frequently than males by a ratio of approximately three to two.  Reports indicate that the mean parental age is older than average for the mothers and fathers of children with Monosomy 18p (i.e., age 32 years and 38 years, respectively).  Since Monosomy 18p was originally described in 1963, over 120 cases have been reported in the medical literature.', 'Hemophilia A is the most common X-linked recessive disorder and the second most common inherited clotting factor deficiency after von Willebrand disease. Hemophilia A mostly affects males but females can also be affected. Approximately 1 in 5,000 males born have hemophilia A. Approximately 60% of individuals with hemophilia A have a severe form of the disorder. All racial and ethnic groups are equally affected by hemophilia.', 'Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is a rare heart condition characterized by abnormal positioning of the heart. In this condition, the tip of the heart (apex) is positioned on the right side of the chest. Additionally, the position of the heart chambers as well as the visceral organs such as the liver and spleen is reversed (situs inversus). However, most affected individuals can live a normal life without associated symptoms or disability. Electrocardiography reveals an inversion of the electrical waves from the heart and is the diagnostic measure of choice. Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is present at birth.  The condition affects males and females in equal numbers. Treatment of Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus is symptomatic and supportive when needed. In most cases, affected individuals can live a normal life without any symptoms or discomfort. If the condition is associated with other more serious heart malformations, the prognosis and treatment will vary. Genetic counseling may be helpful for affected families.', 'Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by the lack of normal color (hypopigmentation) of the skin and hair and abnormalities of the central nervous system that affect the eyes and certain parts of the brain (oculocerebral). Physical findings at birth include unusually light skin color and silvery-gray hair. Abnormal findings associated with the central nervous system may include abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (microphthalmia); clouding (opacities) of the front, clear portion of the eye through which light passes (cornea); and/or rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). Additional symptoms that may develop during infancy include involuntary muscle contractions, associated loss of muscle function (spastic paraplegia), developmental delays, and/or mental retardation. Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.', 'Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (LI)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e.  Nanism is another word for dwarfism. A characteristic feature not included in the original acronym is the overgrowth of the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart restricting normal filling of the heart (constrictive pericarditis). Characteristic symptoms may include low birth weight, short stature, and severe progressive growth delays. Muscles are usually underdeveloped and lack normal tone (hypotonia). Some infants with this disorder may have an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). Infants typically have yellow discoloration in their eyes. Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.   Approximately 110 patients have been reported worldwide with this condition.  Most of the reported cases are from Finland but this condition has also occurred in North America, South America, Central America, Spain, France and Egypt.', 'Partial monosomy 11q, also known as Jacobsen syndrome, is a rare chromosomal disorder in which a portion of chromosome 11 is deleted (missing). The range and severity of symptoms varies, greatly depending on the exact location and size of the missing genetic material. Symptoms commonly associated with partial monosomy 11q include abnormally slow growth before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal physical growth retardation), moderate to severe delay in the acquisition of skills requiring the coordination of mental and muscular activity and intellectual disability. Rarely, individuals may have normal/borderline intelligence while most children have mild to severe intellectual disability. Characteristic physical abnormalities may include dimorphism (unusual shape) of the head and face (craniofacial), hands, feet, congenital defects of the ear, bleeding due to platelet abnormalities, and immunological defects. The exact cause of partial monosomy 11q is not fully understood. Partial monosomy 11q is an extremely rare chromosomal disorder that is apparent at birth. The disorder was initially described in the medical literature in 1973. Since that time, more than 200 cases have been described in the medical literature. According to some sources, more females are affected than males. The prevalence has been estimated at 1/100,000 births.', 'Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare disorder that affects females 4 times as often as males. Type 1 is more common and is usually diagnosed in adults. Type 2 is more common in children and often involves a more severe disease process. There are also variant types of AIH; these include individuals with AIH and one of the other autoimmune liver diseases (primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cholangitis).Those with other autoimmune conditions have a 25-50% chance of developing another one and thus a higher risk for developing AIH. The new cases per year (incidence) are estimated at 1-2 per 100,000 and total cases (prevalence) are approximately 24 per 100,000. Studies suggest that the incidence of AIH is increasing and the reason is unknown.', 'Mucha-Habermann disease affects men more often than women. The disorder is most common in children and young adults, but can affect people of any age including newborns (with lesions present at birth) and the elderly. The incidence of Mucha-Habermann disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Mucha-Habermann disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic skin lesions and, if needed for confirmation, microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue.', 'The symptoms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which are typically apparent at birth and continue throughout life, may include the tendency to bleed excessively from cuts and other injuries, nosebleeds (epistaxis), and/or an unusually heavy menstrual flow in women. Some babies and children with BSS have no symptoms and the disorder does not present until adult life. People with this disease also bruise easily and the bruises tend to linger. Bleeding from very small blood vessels under the skin (subcutaneous) may cause small or widespread areas of small red or purple colored spots (purpura or petechiae). Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Recent estimates suggest that Bernard Soulier syndrome affects 1 in a million people. More than 200 cases have been reported worldwide. The diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome is made by a combination of blood testing to reveal whether platelets are at abnormally low levels (thrombocytopenia), microscopic examination to determine the presence of abnormally large platelets and irregularly shaped platelets, and a test called ‘flow cytometry, which is able to measure the level of expression of the missing protein ion the outside of platelets affected by Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In recent years, most families are offered molecular genetic testing to identify which gene carries the mutations.', 'Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare genetic muscle disease that is usually apparent at birth (congenital myopathy). It belongs to a group of muscle conditions called the congenital myopathies that tend to affect people in a similar pattern. Major symptoms may include loss of muscle tone (hypotonia) and generalized muscle weakness. Delays in motor development are common and people with more marked muscle weakness also have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), dislocated hips, and the permanent fixation of certain joints in a flexed position (contractures), particularly at the ankle. CFTD affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of the disorder in the general population is unknown but it is uncommon. The disorder is usually present at birth (congenital) but may not be recognized for many months. Case reports describing children with the features of CFTD first appeared in the medical literature in the 1960s and 70s. The term congenital fiber type disproportion was first used in 1973.', 'Most reports in the medical literature state that Sprengel deformity affects females more often than males by a ratio of 3-1. However, other reports state that the disorder affects males and females in equal numbers.', 'Hydrocephalus is a condition in which abnormally widened (dilated) cerebral spaces in the brain (ventricles) inhibit the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull and puts pressure on the brain tissue. An enlarged head in infants and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure are frequent findings but are not necessary for the diagnosis of Hydrocephalus. There are several different forms of Hydrocephalus: communicating hydrocephalus, non-communicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus, internal hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and benign hydrocephalus. Most cases of Hydrocephalus are diagnosed in the first 2 years of life, but onset may occur at any age, depending on the cause.  Most types of Hydrocephalus (with the exception of those caused by an X-linked genetic trait) seem to affect males and females equally.', 'Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder that belongs to the group of diseases known as ectodermal dysplasias. Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, sweat glands, and/or skin. HED is primarily characterized by partial or complete absence of certain sweat glands (eccrine glands), causing lack of or diminished sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), heat intolerance, and fever; abnormally sparse hair (hypotrichosis), and absence (hypodontia) and/or malformation of certain teeth. Many individuals with HED also have characteristic facial abnormalities including a prominent forehead, a sunken nasal bridge (so-called "saddle nose"), unusually thick lips, and/or a large chin. The skin on most of the body may be abnormally thin, dry, and soft with an abnormal lack of pigmentation (hypopigmentation). However, the skin around the eyes (periorbital) may be darkly pigmented (hyperpigmentation) and finely wrinkled, appearing prematurely aged. In many cases, affected infants and children may also exhibit underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (aplasia) of mucous glands within the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and, in some cases, decreased function of certain components of the immune system (e.g., depressed lymphocyte function, and rarely cellular immune hypofunction), potentially causing an increased susceptibility to certain infections and/or allergic conditions. Many affected infants and children experience recurrent attacks of wheezing and breathlessness (asthma), respiratory infections; chronic inflammation of the nasal passages (atrophic rhinitis), scaling, itchy (pruritic) skin rashes (eczema), and/or other findings.', 'Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is a genetic disorder that causes the body to breakdown (metabolize) fats (lipids) incorrectly. This results in the buildup of lipids in the body (hyperlipidemia) and can lead to the development of multiple small, yellow skin growths (xanthomas). Affected individuals may also develop the buildup of fatty materials in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis) blocking blood flow and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III affects 1-5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the general population. Without treatment, affected individuals are 5-10 times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.', 'Hereditary angioedema is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood. An estimated one in 50,000 to 150,000 individuals is affected by this disorder worldwide. The diagnosis of hereditary angioedema is made by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and blood tests that detect decreased levels of complement proteins. In instances of high clinical suspicion and recurrent episodic angioedema of uncertain etiology, genetic testing is indicated.', 'Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of cystic malformations in the collecting ducts and the tubular structures within the kidneys (tubules) that collect urine. One or both kidneys may be affected. The initial symptoms of this disorder may include blood in the urine (hematuria), calcium stone formation in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) or infection. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known. The exact cause of Medullary Sponge Kidney is not known and most cases occur sporadically for no apparent reason.  Some cases are thought to run in families (familial) and may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.  However, this inheritance pattern has not been proven.  Some studies have suggested there may be a a possible relationship between overactivity of the parathyroid gland (Hyperparathyroidism) and Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney is a rare disorder that affects slightly more women than men.  It is thought to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people in the United States.  Although the symptoms of Medullary Sponge Kidney may begin at any age, they usually develop during adolescence or in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years.  Approximately 13 percent of all people who develop kidney stones are eventually diagnosed with Medullary Sponge Kidney. Medullary Sponge Kidney may also develop in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.  (For more information on Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, see the related disorders section of this report.)', 'Bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is a spectrum of anomalies involving the urinary tract, genital tract, musculoskeletal system and sometimes the intestinal tract. In classic bladder exstrophy, most anomalies are related to defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitalia, pelvic bones, rectum and anus. In normal development, the cloacal membrane temporarily separates the urogenital and anal structures and them breaks when tissue that will form abdominal muscles begins to grow in its place.   The bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is caused by a developmental abnormality that occurs 4-5 weeks after conception in which the cloacal membrane is not replaced by tissue that will form the abdominal muscles.  The underlying cause of this error in development is not known. The birth prevalence of classic bladder exstrophy has been estimated to be between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 livebirths.  Males are affected 2-3 times more often than females.  Isolated epispadias occurs in approximately 1 in 112,000 live male births and 1 in 400,000 live female births.  Cloacal exstrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 400,000 live births. Prenatal ultrasound examination of a fetus with the complex may reveal absence of bladder filling, low-set umbilical cord, separation of pubic bones, small genitals and an abdominal mass that increases in size as the pregnancy progresses.', 'Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders in which stored glycogen cannot be metabolized into glucose to supply energy for the body. Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells. Molecular genetic testing for the phosphofructokinase gene mutations prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population are available on a research basis.', 'Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, tumor-like malformations that occur during fetal development and are present at birth. They are non-progressive lesions and do not expand, spread or metastasize to other locations. They grow in proportion to normal brain growth, and consequently their relative size to the rest of the brain is the same for the lifetime of the patient. There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures. These tumors can, however, be associated with endocrine dysfunction, which includes precocious puberty under rare circumstances.', 'The prevalence of porphyria remains unknown, but clinicians suggest that a range of 1 per 500-50,000 of population is probable. Some forms of porphyria are more common in specific populations including, for example, in Finland.', 'The incidence and prevalence of Catel-Manzke syndrome is unknown. More than 33 individuals with the disorder have been reported in the medical literature. Since some individuals may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of Catel-Manzke syndrome in the general population is difficult. More males have been described with the disorder than females, but this may be a coincidence since so few individuals have been reported in the medical literature.', 'Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the skin. Connective tissue is composed of collagen, which supports and binds other body tissues. There are several types of scleroderma. Some types affect certain, specific parts of the body, while other types can affect the whole body and internal organs (systemic). Scleroderma is also known as progressive systemic sclerosis. The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. The systemic form of scleroderma is thought to affect from 40,000 to 165,000 people in the United States. The disease is three to four times more common in females than in males. Scleroderma may occur at any age but the symptoms most frequently begin during midlife.', 'Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder of the jaw involving abnormal tissue growth. The resulting tumors or cysts are usually not malignant (benign) but the tissue growth may be aggressive in the involved area. On occasion, tissue near the jaws, such as around the sinuses and eye sockets, may become involved as well. The tissues involved are most often those that give rise to the teeth so that ameloblastoma may cause facial distortion. Malignancy is uncommon as are metastases, but they do occur. The cause of ameloblastoma is not understood.  Causes may include injury to the mouth or jaw, infections of the teeth or gums, or inflammation of these same areas.  Infections by viruses or lack of protein or minerals in the persons diet are also suspected of causing the growth or development of these tumors.  In general, however, scientists do not understand the cause of cysts and tumors, nor the reasons why they can become malignant. Ameloblastoma is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  It affects persons of all ethnic backgrounds and of all age groups. Ameloblastoma can show up either in a regular x-ray or in an MRI imaging study.', 'Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition caused by an overactive, abnormal response of the immune system. The immune system is the body’s natural defense system against foreign or invading organisms or substances. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the immune system responds to a stimulus or ‘trigger’, often an infection, but the response is ineffective and abnormal. This ineffective, abnormal response, causes a variety of signs and symptoms, which, if not treated, can potentially become life-threatening. Some affected individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This is known as the primary or familial form. In other individuals, the disorder occurs sporadically usually when there is an underlying predisposing condition or disorder. This is known as the secondary form. The secondary forms are more common than the familial forms. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants from birth to 18 months, but can affect individuals of any age. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants or young children, but can affect individuals of any age. It affects boys and girls in equal numbers. In adults, it affects men slightly more often than women. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. Rare disorders often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. About 25% of the people with this disorder, have the familial form.', 'Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.', 'Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by scaling skin, hair anomalies, increased susceptibility to atopic eczema (a skin condition that can result in dry, red and flaky skin), elevated IgE levels, and other related symptoms. Netherton syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Netherton syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder.  There are approximately 150 cases reported in the medical literature, but the true number of affected individuals may be much higher due to diagnostic difficulties and overlapping symptoms with common atopic dermatitis and other congenital ichthyoses.', 'Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is mainly characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision during young adult life. In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is transmitted by maternal inheritance. LHON affects approximately 1:50,000 people. Many carriers never suffer significant visual loss; males are about four to five times more likely than females to be affected. LHON affects both males and females and can only be inherited from a female. The birth prevalence of LHON is approximately 1 in 50,000 people. LHON is diagnosed based on ophthalmologic findings, which include specialized visual testing. The testing involves dilated fundus examination to identify characteristic changes in the optic disc and vascular changes during the acute phase, electrophysiologic studies, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic testing for mitochondrial genes associated with LHON can be used to confirm diagnosis. Most affected individuals know if their family members also are affected by LHON.', 'DOOR syndrome appears to affect males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.', 'Norrie disease is a rare X-linked disorder that occurs due to errors or disruption (mutations) of the NDP gene. Norrie disease is a rare disorder that is fully expressed in males only. In rare cases, carrier females may display some symptoms of the disorder. The incidence and prevalence rates for Norrie disease are unknown. The disorder has been reported in all ethnic groups. A diagnosis of Norrie disease is suspected based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of characteristic findings. There may be a family history supporting X-linked inheritance. A diagnosis may be confirmed by molecular genetic testing in which a mutation in the defective gene (NDP) is identified. Such testing is available through clinical testing labs (www.genetests.org).', 'BAM syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is known to affect patients from many different ethnic groups. As with many rare disorders, the exact incidence or prevalence of this disorder is unknown. The disorder probably goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. Fewer than 100 people with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature.', 'Keratoconus is an eye (ocular) disorder characterized by progressive thinning and changes in the shape of the cornea. The cornea is the thin, clear outer layer of the eye and is normally dome-shaped. Slowly progressive thinning of the cornea causes a cone-shaped bulge to develop towards the center of the cornea in the areas of greatest thinning. Affected individuals develop blurry or distorted vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and additional vision problems. Keratoconus often begins at puberty and most often is seen in teenagers or young adults. The specific underlying cause is not fully understood and most likely the condition results from the interaction of multiple factors including genetic and environmental ones. One factor known to contribute to progression of keratoconus is eye rubbing.  In some cases, keratoconus may occur as part of a larger disorder. Keratoconus is treated with glasses or contact lenses early in the condition. A small number of individuals may require surgery.']

Processed Training Data: [{'text': 'Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare disorder that occurs in some individuals with reduced kidney function, who have been exposed to an intravenous contrast material that contains gadolinium. A contrast material is a dye that is sometimes used during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The term, fibrosis, refers to the thickening and scarring of connective tissue, most often the consequence of inflammation or injury. NSF is characterized by thickening and hardening (fibrosis) of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and, sometimes, underlying skeletal muscle. The arms and legs are most often affected. In some cases, the skin on the trunk can also become involved. This proliferation of fibrotic tissue may become systemic, extending to other areas including the smooth, delicate membrane that surrounds the lungs (pleura), the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), the thin sheet of muscle that aids respiration by moving up and down when breathing (diaphragm), and the outermost layer (dura mater) of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnostic criteria for NSF have been recently developed. A diagnosis of NSF is usually made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical examination and identification of characteristic findings. Surgical removal and microscopic study of a small sample of affected skin tissue (skin biopsy) is required to verify the diagnosis. Additional tests may be performed to exclude several other disorders that can resemble NSF.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 19\tCerebellar agenesis\nT2\tANAPHOR 112 124\tthe disorder\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 163 202\tCongenital isolated cerebellar agenesis\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 299 318\tcerebellar agenesis\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 478 497\tcerebellar agenesis\nT6\tSIGN 647 709\tdestruction of the cerebellum during later stages of pregnancy\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tIs_a Arg1:T3 Arg2:T1\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\n'}, {'text': 'Keratosis follicularis affects males and females in equal numbers.

In the acute form, respiratory symptoms and fever begin several hours after exposure to the dust. The chronic form is characterized by gradual changes in the lung tissue associated with several years of exposure to the irritant. In general, symptoms of all forms of Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis include breathing difficulty, wheezing, and dry coughs that appear to shake the entire body.  Chills, sweating, aching, discomfort and/or fatigue may accompany lung symptoms.  Most cases of this disorder are characterized by mild, short episodes that may be misdiagnosed.  Chronic cases may develop with repeated episodes or prolonged exposure to a specific organic dust. These may involve more severe symptoms including fever, crackling sounds during breathing (rales), breathing difficulty, bluish appearance of the skin (cyanosis), and possibly, expectoration of blood 3. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis may affect males and females in equal numbers, but usually affects individuals in occupations in which animal or vegetable dusts are inhaled by people allergic to the substances contained in such dusts. Treatment of extrinsic allergic alveolitis initially depends on identification of the cause of the allergic reaction. If possible, the patient should avoid exposure to the allergen. In an occupational setting, mild cases may be alleviated by improved ventilation or use of air filtering masks. In severe or prolonged cases, however, changing jobs may be the better option. If symptoms persist in spite of avoidance, corticosteroid drugs may be tried. In acute cases, steroids in combination with avoidance measures can often reduce the severity of symptoms. All symptoms can usually be resolved in acute cases if they are diagnosed and treated early before permanent changes in the lungs can develop. If permanent lung changes have occurred at the time of diagnosis, it is possible that the patient may not respond well to treatment.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 14\tWilson disease\nT2\tANAPHOR 83 94\tThe disease\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 181 197\tWilson’s disease\nT4\tDISEASE 470 482;505 514\tneurological disorders\nT5\tDISEASE 484 489;505 514\tliver disorders\nT6\tDISEASE 493 514\tpsychiatric disorders\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 590 606\tWilson’s disease\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\n'}, {'text': 'Sialadenitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and enlargement of one or more of the salivary glands, the glands that secrete saliva into the mouth.

Horses, dogs, and other small animals may harbor WNE after being bitten; however, they are inefficient transmitters because viral titers are relatively low, and WNE viremia is short-lived in these animals. In the US the initial cases of WNE were first identified in the greater New York area, but cases have now occurred in western states. Wild birds with WNE virus have also been identified in parts of Canada. WNE is common in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa WNE seropositivity of children in Egypt is approximately 50%.

The symptoms and severity of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. Common symptoms include inflammation of the muscles (myositis), inflammation of several joints (polyarthritis), interstitial lung disease, thickening and cracking of the skin of the hands, and a condition called Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers or toes are numb or have a prickly sensation in response to cold. Affected individuals also have nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, unexplained fevers, and unintended weight loss. The exact, underlying cause is not fully understood. Antisynthetase syndrome sometimes occurs along with other conditions such as uncommon inflammatory muscle diseases like dermatomyositis or polymyositis.

Although it is sometimes called German measles or three-day measles, it is not caused by the same virus that causes measles. Rubella is generally mild in children and more severe but not life-threatening in adults. However, if a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, it can cause serious problems for the unborn child. In the United States, most children receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and therefore the disease has become uncommon. In March 2005, health officials announced that rubella has been eliminated from the United States. However, it is still important for Americans to vaccinate their children, and women who are pregnant or might get pregnant still need to be sure they are immune, because the disease exists elsewhere. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nine rubella cases were reported in the United States in 2004, and all of them originated in other countries. Rubella affects males and females in equal numbers.  During 1964 and 1965, according to the CDC, a rubella epidemic in the United States caused an estimated 12.5 million cases of rubella and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome, which led to more than 11,600 babies born deaf, 11,250 fetal deaths, 2,100 neonatal deaths, 3,580 babies born blind, and 1,800 babies born mentally retarded.  Since 1969, the rubella virus has been included in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine routinely given to babies and young children.

The severity of SLOS varies greatly in affected individuals, even in the same family, and some have normal development and only minor birth defects. SLOS is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that results in an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism.  SLOS is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. For the US the birth prevalence of SLOS has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 live births.  The predicted prevalence based on newborn screening for gene carriers is estimated to be 1 in 1,590 to 13,500 and this discrepancy may be due to the fact that many fetuses with SLOS are stillborn.   This condition occurs equally in males and females but females are often not diagnosed because genital abnormalities are missed.  SLOS occurs more often in individuals of European ancestry. The diagnosis of SLOS is based on physical findings and detection of an elevated concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in blood serum or an elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol:cholesterol ratio. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the DHCR7 gene is available and is mainly used for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tDISEASE 0 16\tPityriasis rosea\nT2\tDISEASE 33 51\tmild skin disorder\nT3\tSIGN 71 105\tsalmon or pink colored, scaly rash\nT4\tDISEASE 107 123\tPityriasis rosea\nT5\tDISEASE 195 211\tpityriasis rosea\nT6\tSIGN 232 236\trash\nT7\tSIGN 285 293;316 346\tresemble an upper respiratory infection\nT8\tSIGN 352 356\trash\nT9\tSIGN 509 513\trash\nT10\tDISEASE 540 556\tpityriasis rosea\nT11\tDISEASE 711 727\tpityriasis rosea\nT12\tANAPHOR 785 797\tthe disorder\nT13\tANAPHOR 842 854\tThe disorder\nT14\tDISEASE 995 1011\tPityriasis rosea\nT15\tDISEASE 1090 1106\tpityriasis rosea\nT16\tANAPHOR 1258 1270\tthe disorder\nT17\tDISEASE 1353 1369\tpityriasis rosea\nT18\tDISEASE 1383 1397\tskin disorders\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T17 Arg2:T160\t\nR10\tIs_a Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\n'}, {'text': 'Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a term for a specific pattern of damage to the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs in the body, one on each side of the body just below the rib cage in the back. The kidney has multiple functions including filtering the blood of waste products and other substances and producing urine to carrying waste from the body. FSGS occurs when the filters of the kidney, which are made of clusters of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and known as renal glomeruli, become scarred or hardened (sclerosis). Each kidney has about a million glomeruli, which are part of a larger structure called the nephron; the nephron is the basic unit of the kidneys. The glomeruli help to filter out waste products and extra fluid from the blood. Scarring or damage to the glomeruli can lead to an inability of the kidneys to process waste products and eliminate those waste products from the body through the urine. Ultimately, these abnormalities lead to progressive kidney damage including decreased function and efficiency of the kidneys, and potentially kidney failure. There are different causes of FSGS and, in some instances, the cause is unknown. Depending on the cause, FSGS may be treated with certain medications, but sometimes despite treatment affected individuals will eventually require dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 23\tAcromesomelic dysplasia\nT2\tDISEASE 46 55;57 86\tinherited progressive skeletal disorder\nT3\tSIGN 124 137\tshort stature\nT4\tDISEASE 147 166\tshort-limb dwarfism\nT5\tSIGN 147 166\tshort-limb dwarfism\nT6\tANAPHOR 168 180\tThe disorder\nT7\tSIGN 201 210\tacromelia\nT8\tSIGN 215 224\tmesomelia\nT9\tSIGN 226 235\tMesomelia\nT10\tSIGN 349 358\tAcromelia\nT11\tSIGN 423 436\tshort stature\nT12\tSIGN 564 576\tshort hands,\nT13\tSIGN 564 569;577 584\tshort fingers\nT14\tSIGN 564 569;586 590\tshort feet\nT15\tSIGN 564 569;596 600\tshort toes\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 737 761\tHunter-Thompson type ADM\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 793 811\tMaroteaux type AMD\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 871 885\tGrebe type ADM\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T15\t\n'}, {'text': 'Essential iris atrophy is a very rare, progressive disorder of the eye characterized by a pupil that is out of place and/or distorted areas of degeneration on the iris (atrophy), and/or holes in the iris.

GCA causes changes in blood vessel walls leading to poor blood circulation. Arteries most affected in giant cell arteritis are the temporal artery and other cranial arteries (now called cranial-GCA), but inflammation of the aorta and other large arteries in the body can occur as well and may present differently (now called large vessel-GCA). If left untreated, this can lead to a medical emergency where sudden blindness occurs without early detection and treatment. Signs and symptoms when the temporal or other cranial arteries are involved include arm pain, pulsing headaches on one side or on the back of the head, jaw pain, scalp tenderness, double vision or other visual disturbances, bulging temporal artery that is tender with skin edema and redness. It can also present with constitutional symptoms such as polymyalgia, fevers, anorexia, and weight loss, a presentation of LV-GCA. The cause of giant cell arteritis is still unknown but is thought to be from the immune system causing damage to the body’s own blood vessels. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that is closely related to giant cell arteritis and occurs in 40% to 60% of patients with giant call arteritis. 15% to 20% of persons with polymyalgia rheumatica will have giant cell arteritis.

Due to abnormal thickening and shortening of the bands of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the palm (palmar fascia), a hardened nodule may develop, eventually forming an abnormal band of hardened (fibrotic) tissue. As a result, the fingers of the affected area begin to be drawn in toward the palm over several months or years and cannot be pulled back (contracture). In addition, the skin of the affected area may pucker. In most cases, the ring and pinky (fourth and fifth) fingers are most affected. In addition, the disorder usually affects both hands (bilateral). Although the exact cause of Dupuytren's contracture is unknown, risk for the disorder appears to be increased by alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis) and the presence or certain other diseases, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. In addition, it is thought that genetic predisposition may be a factor. Dupuytren’s contracture is characterized by a drawing up of the fingers toward the palms of the hand.  The feet are rarely involved.  Loss of function of the fingers and deformities may also occur, including nodular growths on the fingers.  One or both hands may be affected.  The right hand seems to be more frequently involved when involvement is only one sided (unilateral).  The ring finger is involved most often, followed in order by the little, middle and index fingers.  A nodule or plaque may develop as the first symptom on the finger.  Symptoms may develop spontaneously and without any known associated condition.  In other cases liver disease, alcoholism, pulmonary tuberculosis or diabetes mellitus may occur in conjunction with Dupuytren’s contracture. Dupuytren’s contracture is a disease of the fibrous tissue.  Its cause is unknown, but genetic predisposition and the presence of other diseases or medical conditions may be factors.  It appears that one’s risk is increased by certain lifestyle factors, such as alcoholism, and the presence of certain diseases, such as liver disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy. The diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation including a comprehensive patient history, observation of characteristic findings, and specialized tests.

The endocrine system is the network of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. These hormones regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the function of various organs and activities within the body. Hormones are involved in numerous vital processes including regulating heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Glands affected in MEN2 may secrete excessive amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, which can result in a variety of symptoms. MEN2 affects males and females in equal numbers. It has been estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 people in the general population. Some researchers believe that many cases of MEN2 go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. MEN2A is the most common subtype accounting for more than 80 percent of cases. MEN2B is the least common accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases.

In most patients the pupil is larger than normal (dilated) and slow to react in response to direct light. Absent or poor tendon reflexes are also associated with this disorder. In most individuals, the cause is unknown (idiopathic), but Adie syndrome can occur as due to other conditions such as trauma, surgery, lack of blood flow (ischemia) or infection. In rare cases localized disturbance of sweat secretion is associated with Adie syndrome (Ross syndrome). Adie syndrome involves a usually non progressive and limited damage to the autonomic nervous system, which is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates certain involuntary body functions including the reaction of the pupils to stimuli. Adie syndrome affects females more often than males by a ratio by some estimates of 2.6:1 for cases where the cause is unknown. Young adults usually between the ages of 25 to 45 are most commonly affected. The prevalence of Adie’s pupil (not the full syndrome) is approximately 2 people per 1,000 in the general population. The exact incidence or prevalence of Adie syndrome itself is unknown. In most instances, treatment will not be necessary.

Contact with a carrier of the bacterium, polluted water, infected food or milk, shellfish harvested from polluted water, or fresh vegetables grown in contaminated soil are all sources of the Salmonella Typhi bacterium.  People who have had Typhoid are “carriers” until the bacteria is completely gone from their body.  If they touch food served to other people when their hands are not properly washed, they can spread Typhoid to those who eat the food. Typhoid is treated with the antibiotic drugs chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefoperazone, pefloxacin, co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Precautions to take, especially when visiting countries with unsanitary conditions, includes the practice of good personal hygiene and careful washing of hands. Avoid drinking untreated water, drinks served with ice, unpeeled fruits and vegetables, and other food that is cooked and not served hot. In food preparation; wash and sanitize utensils in hot water; carefully clean cutting boards, work areas and equipment; keep hot foods at 165 F and cold foods at 40 F or colder to avoid the possible growth of bacteria in food.

A diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is made through the exclusion of other causes of upper right abdominal pain. A diagnosis may be confirmed with a variety of specialized tests including x-ray examination, diagnostic laparoscopy, and certain laboratory exams. X-ray examination may include ultrasound, chest or stomach radiographs, and computed tomography (CT) scanning. X-rays are used to rule out other possible conditions or reveal characteristic inflammation of the perihepatic region.

Anemia is characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen. Anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. In mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness. The underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood. Anemia of chronic disease varies in severity from one person to another. In most cases, anemia is usually mild or moderate. Affected individuals may develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, irritability, chest pain and additional findings. These symptoms may occur in any individual who has a comparable degree of anemia. In most cases, the symptoms associated with the underlying disease usually take precedent over the mild or moderate anemia symptoms. In rare cases, anemia of chronic disease can be severe and cause more serious complications. Anemia of chronic disease affects males and females in equal proportion. Individuals of any age who have a chronic, inflammatory condition can potentially develop the condition. The exact incidence of anemia of chronic disease is unknown and some researchers believe that it is underreported or often goes unrecognized. Anemia of chronic disease is believed to be the second most common cause of anemia in the United States after iron-deficiency anemia. A diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests can measure the levels of certain substances in the body including hemoglobin levels, the levels of iron in the serum, total iron binding capacity, overall red blood cell count, or normal or increased levels of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body’s iron stores in the blood plasma. Another test that may be performed measures transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a protein that is involved in the transport of iron from the intestines into the bloodstream. Methods to allow the reliable measurement of hepcidin in plasma have been developed but are not available or approved for use in the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease at present.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 7\tApraxia\nT2\tDISEASE 13 34\tneurological disorder\nT3\tSIGN 56 105\tinability to perform learned (familiar) movements\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 358 365\tapraxia\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 374 381\tapraxia\nT6\tDISEASE 396 404\tdementia\nT7\tDISEASE 408 414\tstroke\nT8\tANAPHOR 416 418\tit\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\n'}, {'text': "Kikuchi's disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenopathy, is a rare, benign, (noncancerous, nonmalignant) disorder of the lymph nodes of young adults, predominantly of young women.

In theory, it affects males and females in equal numbers. However, in observed cases, more females than males have been identified. More than 30 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of Björnstad Syndrome may be suspected by the finding of twisted hair (i.e., pili torti), which may be obvious at birth. The diagnosis is confirmed by examination of hair shafts from affected individuals under an electron microscope, demonstrating characteristic twisting of the hair shafts at regular intervals.

In women, hyperprolactinemia is characterized by irregular menstrual periods or even absence of periods, infertility and production of breast milk in women who are not pregnant (galactorrhea). The most common symptom in men is impotence. The cause of pituitary tumors is unknown. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic and not associated with genetic factors that are inherited or can be passed on to children. Pituitary tumors that produce enough prolactin to affect health occur in approximately 14 out of 100,000 people. All patients who are shown to have a pituitary adenoma on MRI or CT imaging should have a serum prolactin level checked and if their prolactin level is >150-200 ng/ml the patient likely harbors a prolactin secreting tumor which should be treated with a dopamine agonist medication rather than surgery. If the level is less, this could be due to a tumor <10 mm or lack of normal inhibition by hypothalamic dopamine which then permits the normal prolactin secreting cells to hypersecrete (stalk effect). The effect of certain medications, recreational drugs, macroprolactin (big prolactin molecule with no effect on the body), other medical conditions (like low thyroid function, hepatic or renal insufficiency) should be evaluated for these lower levels. A specialist consultation should be considered for such patients by an experienced endocrinologist. Prolactinoma is treated with medications that act like dopamine (dopamine agonists) such as bromocriptine, quinagolide and cabergoline because dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion. These medications reduce the size of the tumor and reduce the amount of prolactin secretion in approximately 80-90% of patients. Surgery may be recommended if medical therapy is not effective or bothersome side effects (dizziness, mental fogginess, nausea, vomiting). For both medical therapy and surgery, cure rates depend on the size and location of the tumor and the prolactinoma can recur in some affected individuals. Radiation therapy is sometimes used to control growth of a prolactinoma if no response to medications and not amenable to surgery.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tDISEASE 0 12\tSpina bifida\nT2\tSIGN 33 62;91 100\tincomplete closure of certain vertebrae\nT3\tSIGN 113 148\tportion of the spinal cord exposed.\nT4\tDISEASE 290 302\tSpina bifida\nT5\tSIGN 313 346\tdifficulties with bladder control\nT6\tSIGN 313 330;348 355\tdifficulties with walking\nT7\tDISEASE 430 442\tSpina bifida\nT8\tDISEASE 462 480\tneural tube defect\nT9\tANAPHOR 578 591\tthis disorder\nT10\tDISEASE 624 636\tSpina bifida\nT11\tANAPHOR 677 679\tit\nT12\tANAPHOR 744 746\tIt\nT13\tDISEASE 787 806\tneural tube defects\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T60\t\nR5\tIs_a Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tAnaphora Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tIs_a Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n'}, {'text': 'An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a rare benign (non-cancerous) growth that develops on the eighth cranial nerve.

Doctors must suppress the immune system to help the body accept the transplant and avoid rejection. Individuals receive these drugs at the time of the transplant (induction therapy) and must remain on these drugs for the rest of their lives (maintenance therapy). Immunosuppressive therapy leaves patients at a greater risk of developing infections and, in some people, of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of these disorders are extremely important. The incidence and prevalence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease varies based on the type of transplant and affects about 1%-2% of people who have received a kidney (renal) transplant.

The scientific name for the tapeworm that causes cysticercosis is Taenia solium (T. solium), which is also known as the pork tapeworm. T. solium cysts (cysticerci) may affect any area of the body including the brain, a condition known as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms vary from case to case. If cysticerci are located in the brain, central nervous system abnormalities may occur, most often seizures and headaches. Cysticercosis may also affect the eyes, spinal cord, skin and heart. Cysticercosis affects males and females in equal numbers. Some forms of cysticercosis such as racemose cysticercosis occur more frequently in females. Approximately 1,000 cases of cysticercosis are reported each year in the United States. The disease is more common in Mexico, Latin America, South America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Cysticercosis cases have risen in the United States following increased immigration from endemic areas. Tapeworms can be acquired from various uncooked meats, including beef and fish, but only pork tapeworms appear to produce larvae capable of invading human muscle and forming cysts. A diagnosis of cysticercosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of specialized tests.

QT prolongation predisposes those affected to an increased risk of life threatening sudden alterations in the cardiac rhythm, (termed arrhythmias), specifically torsade de pointes (TdP) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias can lead to sudden loss of consciousness (syncope), cardiac arrest and potentially cause sudden cardiac death. The severity of cardiac symptoms varies greatly from one person to another, even among family members who carry the same rare genetic variant. Some individuals may have no apparent symptoms (asymptomatic) for their entire lives, whilst others develop arrhythmias resulting in episodes of syncope, and cardiac arrest, at a young age. Several different factors are known to trigger the onset of symptoms including physical activity, excitement and fright, although cardiac events may occur while asleep or at rest. Long QT syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers and has been identified in all ethnic groups. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is not known.

It is a rare disease of the placenta, the organ that joins the mother to her offspring and provides nourishment to the developing fetuses. During the development of identical twins, there are always blood vessels in the fetuses' shared placenta that connect their blood circulations (placental anastomoses). In most cases, the blood flows properly through these vessels. However, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome, the blood begins to flow unevenly, with one fetal twin receiving too much blood (recipient) and one receiving too little (donor). The recipient twin may experience heart failure due to continual strain on its heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system). The donor twin, on the other hand, may experience life-threatening anemia, insufficient nutrition and oxygen due to its inadequate supply of blood. Such an imbalance in blood flow (i.e., twin-twin transfusion) can occur at any time during the pregnancy, including during delivery. TTTS is a rare disorder that sometimes occurs when a mother is pregnant with identical (monozygotic) twins. There have been a few reported cases in which TTTS also affected identical triplets. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome affects approximately 5 to 15 percent of identical twin pregnancies, meaning that approximately 6,000 babies may be affected each year.

It is believed to result from infection with bacteria known as Tropheryma whippelii. The infection usually involves the small intestine, but over time, the disease may affect various parts of the body, including the heart, lungs, brain, and eyes. Whipple disease is caused by a rod-shaped bacterium called Tropheryma whippelii.  This bacterium was first identified in 1991/92.  Its natural habitats are unknown, but it appears likely that infection occurs by way of an environmental source and that the bacteria are introduced into the body through the mouth (peroral). Whipple disease affects more males than females in a ratio of approximately 4 to 1.  The symptoms of this disorder typically begin between the ages of thirty and sixty years.  The age range of those affected is thought to be between 30 and 80, with the median age at time of diagnosis being 56 years.  Most of the cases of Whipple disease have been diagnosed among Europeans and  Americans of European parentage.  In Germany, the disease incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million population per year.  A few cases have been reported among American Indians and Americans of African descent. In 2004, for the first time, a case of Whipple disease was reported in Japan. The standard diagnostic approach is to study a tissue sample (biopsy) from the small intestine. Blood testing can determine whether anemia is present. Confirmation of diagnosis can be achieved either by electron microscopy or by a test known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which detects the DNA of T. whippelii.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 19\tLevy-Yeboa syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 21 24\tLYS\nT3\tDISEASE 52 97\tinherited (congenital), multi-system disorder\nT4\tSIGN 153 168\tlow muscle tone\nT5\tSIGN 220 232\tcontractions\nT6\tSIGN 235 250\tloss of hearing\nT7\tSIGN 252 269\tneuronal deafness\nT8\tSIGN 336 353\tbullous eruptions\nT9\tSIGN 369 394\tgastrointestinal distress\nT10\tDISEASE 433 451\tsecretory diarrhea\nT11\tSIGN 433 451\tsecretory diarrhea\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 751 770\tLevy-Yeboa syndrome\nT13\tSIGN 807 815\tmyopathy\nT14\tSIGN 817 825\tdeafness\nT15\tSIGN 827 841\tskin eruptions\nT16\tSIGN 846 879\trecurrent, massive, watery stools\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\n'}, {'text': 'Familial eosinophilic cellulitis is a rare skin disorder.

The disease is spread through bites of infected mosquitos. Incidence of the disease tends to increase in the summer as the mosquito population increases, and it occurs year round in tropical climates. Yellow Fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite by an infected mosquito. Initially, a mosquito acquires the disease by ingesting the blood of an infected host.  The mosquito then transmits the infection to its next bite victim. Yellow Fever affects males and females equally. People living in semitropical or tropical climates are at risk unless they are vaccinated against this infection. People in southern areas of the United States, living near marshes and swamps may be at risk during the summer months. However, most cases of Yellow Fever occur in Africa and South America. The treatment of Yellow Fever is symptomatic and supportive. Preventative measures consist of mosquito control and a vaccine that prevents development of the infection. Immunity from a vaccination usually develops after 10 days and lasts for more than 10 years. In some cases, side effects associated with vaccination may occur five to 10 days later.

Characteristic craniofacial features include an abnormally small head (microcephaly); an abnormally small, narrow nose; and down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Skeletal malformations may include fifth fingers that are permanently fixed in a bent position (clinodactyly) and/or abnormally short bones between the wrists and the fingers (metacarpals) and the ankles and toes (metatarsals), resulting in unusually small hands and feet. In addition, affected children may have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and/or unusual prominence of the breastbone (pectus carinatum). Ruvalcaba syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Ruvalcaba syndrome is a rare disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers.  Probably fewer than a dozen confirmed cases have been reported in the medical literature.  Several cases of what were initially  diagnosed as Ruvalcaba syndrome proved to be cases of two related disorders — trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III and Hunter-McAlpine craniosynostosis syndrome.  (For more information on these disorders, see the Related Disorders section below.)  It is highly likely that some cases of Ruvalcaba syndrome may go unrecognized and remain undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. The diagnosis of Ruvalcaba syndrome may be suspected based upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., microcephaly, characteristic facial abnormalities, skeletal malformations, etc.).

The bile duct is a tube that allows the passage of bile from the liver into the gall bladder and, eventually, the small intestine. Bile is a liquid secreted by the liver that plays an essential role in carrying waste products from the liver and promoting absorption of fats and vitamins by the intestines. In biliary atresia, absence or destruction of the bile ducts results in the abnormal accumulation of bile in the liver. Affected infants have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and scarring of the liver (fibrosis). In some cases, additional abnormalities may be present, including heart defects and intestinal, spleen and kidney malformations. The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown. Biliary atresia is a rare disorder with a slight increased frequency in females. It occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 births in the United States. Approximately 400-600 new cases of biliary atresia are encountered in the United States each year. According to one estimate, the prevalence of biliary atresia in Europe is approximately 1 in 12,000 births. Biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. The diagnosis of biliary atresia requires a direct examination of the bile ducts by abdominal surgery (laparotomy) and the microscopic examination of tissue from the liver (liver biopsy). During the surgery special contrast dye is injected into the gallbladder and x-ray films are taken to outline how the dye fills the major bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiogram). These films show the movement (or lack of movement) of the dye through bile ducts and into the small intestine. The physician/surgeon is then able to evaluate the structure of the bile ducts and to determine the site of the blockage (proximal or distal). Blood tests may demonstrate elevated levels of liver enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and bilirubin and detect viral agents; high blood levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 has been discovered to be highly specific for biliary atresia.

For years, some researchers believed that the amniotic fluid and fetal cells cause obstruction within the mother’s blood vessels, but now most researchers believe that the mother’s immune system reacts to the amniotic fluid and fetal cells causing an overwhelming immune system response, which ends up harming the mother and the fetus. Breathing problems, cardiac arrest, and excessive bleeding are some of the life-threatening complications that can occur. Researchers and physicians do not fully understand why amniotic fluid or fetal cells entering the mother’s bloodstream causes this reaction in some women. Amniotic fluid embolism is a medical emergency that develops suddenly and rapidly and can be fatal. Early recognition and prompt supportive treatment are essential. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare complication that occurs just before, during, or immediately after birth. The number of women who have experienced this complication is unknown.  Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare disorder. Rare disorders often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Estimates have ranged from 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 80,000 pregnancies.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 21\tJapanese Encephalitis\nT2\tSIGN 27 59\tsevere inflammation of the brain\nT3\tANAPHOR 209 222\tThis disorder\nT4\tSIGN 327 337\thigh fever\nT5\tSYMPTOM 339 348\theadaches\nT6\tSYMPTOM 350 358\tweakness\nT7\tSYMPTOM 360 366\tnausea\nT8\tSIGN 368 376\tvomiting\nT9\tSIGN 378 387\tparalysis\nT10\tSIGN 389 408\tpersonality changes\nT11\tSIGN 414 418\tcoma\nT12\tSIGN 440 459\tneurological damage\nT13\tSIGN 463 468\tdeath\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 470 491\tJapanese Encephalitis\nT15\tSIGN 721 740\tselective infection\nT16\tSIGN 742 768\tdestruction of nerve cells\nT17\tSIGN 774 804\tweakening of the immune system\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T17\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T18\t\n'}, {'text': 'Tooth agenesis is a condition in which teeth are missing.

In addition, the liver and spleen may become abnormally enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). Laboratory testing may also reveal abnormally elevated levels of certain specialized white blood cells (eosinophilia). The parasite is transmitted through the bite of small flies (A. coliroides). Acanthocheilonemiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by long “thread-like” worms, Acanthocheilonema perstans, also known as Dipetalonema perstans. The disease is transmitted by a small black insect (midge), called A. Cailicoides. Acanthocheilonema perstans, the parasite that causes Acanthocheilonemiasis is common in central Africa and in some areas of South America.  This disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. Acanthocheilonemiasis is treated by means of the administration of antifilarial drugs, some of which are newer than others. Ivermectin or diethyl-carbamazine (DEC) are frequently prescribed. Occasionally, surgery may be required to remove large adult worms.

CPT1A deficiency is caused by an abnormality (mutation) in the CPT1A gene that results in the production of an abnormally functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 enzyme and decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. CPT1A deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Three types of CPT1A deficiency have been recognized:  The hepatic encephalopathy type usually occurs in children and is associated with a low level of ketones in the blood, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), enlarged liver, muscle weakness and elevated carnitine in the blood.  The adult-onset myopathy type is characterized by a sudden onset of muscle cramping associated with exercise without low blood sugar or liver dysfunction.  The third type is acute fatty liver of pregnancy that occurs when a pregnant woman with one abnormal CPT1A gene carries a fetus with two abnormal CPT1A genes and is associated with liver failure in the mother. CPT1A deficiency has been reported in approximately 30-40 individuals.   The incidence of this condition may be higher in the Hutterite populations in the northern United States and Canada and the Inuit populations in northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland.  This condition occurs with equal frequency in males and females. CPT1A deficiency is diagnosed by a combination of physical symptoms and laboratory testing. The typical laboratory findings include low levels of ketones, elevated liver transaminases, elevated ammonia and elevated total serum carnitine.  CPT1A enzyme activity on the cultured skin cells from affected individuals is 1-5% of normal. Molecular genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis if the enzyme test is abnormal.  Some state newborn screening programs perform screening for CPT1A deficiency by measuring the ratio of free to total carnitine in blood plasma or serum. Carrier testing for relatives is available using CPT1A enzyme testing or molecular genetic testing.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 13\tLichen planus\nT2\tSKINRAREDISEASE 15 17\tLP\nT3\tDISEASE 30 95\tchronic, inflammatory autoimmune skin and mucous membrane disease\nT4\tSKINRAREDISEASE 97 99\tLP\nT5\tSIGN 126 131\titchy\nT6\tSIGN 133 138\tshiny\nT7\tSIGN 140 182\treddish-purple spots (lesions) on the skin\nT8\tSKINRAREDISEASE 184 196\tcutaneous LP\nT9\tSIGN 204 235\twhite-gray lesions in the mouth\nT10\tSIGN 204 222;239 250\twhite-gray lesions on the lips\nT11\tSKINRAREDISEASE 252 259\toral LP\nT12\tSKINRAREDISEASE 277 279\tLP\nT13\tSKINRAREDISEASE 311 330\tpenile or vulvar LP\nT14\tSKINRAREDISEASE 340 359\tlichen planopilaris\nT15\tSKINRAREDISEASE 368 375\totic LP\nT16\tSIGN 473 485;496 507;528 533\tskin lesions flat-topped scaly\nT17\tSKINRAREDISEASE 616 618\tLP\nT18\tSKINRAREDISEASE 935 937\tLP\nT19\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1039 1041\tLP\nT20\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1145 1147\tLP\nT21\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1180 1182\tLP\nT22\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1240 1252\tCutaneous LP\nT23\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1347 1354\toral LP\nT24\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1358 1377\tlichen planopilaris\nT25\tANAPHOR 1435 1446\tthe disease\nT26\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1464 1466\tLP\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR3\tIs_a Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T70\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tIs_a Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tIs_a Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tIs_a Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tAnaphora Arg1:T21 Arg2:T25\t\n'}, {'text': 'ALAD porphyria is an extremely rare disorder with few cases reported in the medical literature.

This enzyme complex (sucrase-isomaltase) assists in the breakdown of a certain sugars (i.e., sucrose) and certain products of starch digestion (dextrins). The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex is normally found within the tiny, finger-like projections (microvilli or brush border) lining the small intestine. When this enzyme complex is deficient, nutrients based on ingested sucrose and starch cannot be absorbed properly from the gut.\nSymptoms of this disorder become evident soon after sucrose or starches, as found in modified milk formulas with sucrose or polycose, are ingested by an affected infant. Breast-fed infants or those on lactose-only formula manifest no symptoms until such time as sucrose (found in fruit juices, solid foods, and/or some medications) is introduced into the diet. Symptoms are variable among affected individuals but usually include watery diarrhea, abdominal swelling (distension) and/or discomfort, among others. Intolerance to starch often disappears within the first few years of life and the symptoms of sucrose intolerance usually improve as the affected child ages. CSID is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. CSID is a metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is diagnosed in approximately 0.2 percent of North Americans. This disorder has a higher frequency among Greenland and Canadian Inuit populations, with a reported incidence of approximately 10 percent. In addition, researchers report a higher degree of homozygosity among these more frequently affected groups than among other groups.

Serpiginous Choroiditis is a rare recurrent eye disorder characterized by irregularly shaped (serpiginous) lesions involving two layers of the eye surface (the retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris). No symptoms are apparent unless a specific area of the retina (macula) is damaged. A sudden, painless decrease in vision in one or both eyes may be the first sign of Serpiginous Choroiditis. Patients may also notice blind gaps in the visual field (scotomata) or a sensation of flashes of light (photopsia). Both eyes are commonly affected, although the second eye may not develop lesions for weeks to years after the first eye. The exact cause of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not known. The exact cause of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not known.  Symptoms develop due to lesions that damage the part of the retina that absorbs short wavelengths of light (macular region).  Vision loss may also occur if a membrane composed of fibers and blood vessels (subretinal neovascular membrane) develops and then moves into the macular region.  It has been suggested in the medical literature that an abnormal immune response may cause inflammation of the blood vessels (localized vasculitis) of the eye, leading to the development of Serpiginous Choroiditis.  Some scientists suggest that the disorder is one of impaired blood circulation in the eye membranes.  A few affected individuals have been reported to have had chronic exposure to an unusual variety of chemicals, but the relationship between this exposure and the development of Serpiginous Choroiditis is not clear at this time. Serpiginous Choroiditis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females.

Ordinarily, motor neurons in the brain (upper motor neurons) sent messages to motor neurons in the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) and then to various muscles. ALS affects both the upper and lower motor neurons, so that the transmission of messages is interrupted, and muscles gradually weaken and waste away. As a result, the ability to initiate and control voluntary movement is lost. Ultimately, ALS leads to respiratory failure because affected individuals lose the ability to control muscles in the chest and diaphragm. ALS is often called Lou Gehrig's disease.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex disorder that encompasses a spectrum or continuum of disease that ranges from a subtle condition with no outward signs or symptoms to a severe form that can cause serious, life-threatening complications. Symptoms are related to progressive dysfunction of the brain and may include personality changes, intellectual impairment, impaired memory and loss of consciousness (coma). Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in individuals with acute or chronic liver (hepatic) disease or in individuals whose liver is bypassed by a portosystemic shunt (with no liver disease present). A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal passageway that allows blood from the gastrointestinal tract to bypass the liver. They can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired during life. Hepatic encephalopathy is caused when toxins that are normally cleared from the body by the liver accumulate in the blood, eventually traveling to the brain. Many of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are reversible when promptly detected and treated. A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy may be suspected in some individuals with liver disease based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests that are used to rule out other conditions. Such tests may include a complete blood count, liver function tests, tests that evaluate serum ammonia levels, and an electroencephalogram, which is a test that measures the electrical activity of the brain, may be useful in detecting encephalopathy. Specialized imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans may be used to rule out other conditions affecting the brain such as tumors.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 9 37\tolivopontocerebellar atrophy\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 39 43\tOPCA\nT3\tDISEASE 159 185\tneurodegenerative diseases\nT4\tSIGN 211 281\tprogressive deterioration of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain\nT5\tANAPHOR 283 299\tThese conditions\nT6\tSIGN 351 365\tdisequilibrium\nT7\tDISEASE 441 458\tcerebellar ataxia\nT8\tSIGN 441 458\tcerebellar ataxia\nT9\tSIGN 465 484\tdifficulty speaking\nT10\tSIGN 504 514\tdysarthria\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 517 521\tOPCA\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 779 783\tOPCA\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 858 862\tOPCA\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 985 1000\tHereditary OPCA\nT15\tANAPHOR 1145 1158\tthe condition\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 1248 1252\tOPCA\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 1275 1280\tOPCAs\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 1330 1334\tOPCA\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T60\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T14 Arg2:T150\t\n'}, {'text': "Retinoschisis means splitting of the eye's retina into two layers.

The number of cases of BPD has been increasing most likely because of modern advances in medicine, which have enabled doctors to keep more low birth weight, premature babies alive than in the past.

A diagnosis of BPD is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including blood tests, chest x-rays, and echocardiograms.

One study has suggested a possible connection between schistosomiasis (a parasitic infection found in certain tropical and subtropical countries) and GCC, however a causal relationship has not been established and the vast majority of GCC occur in the absence of schistosomiasis. Recent studies have shown that GCCs do have a unique genomic profile distinct from adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix which may offer future targetable pathways for treatment. There are no genetic, familial or environmental factors known to cause this disorder. It does not run in families. GCC is very rare with approximately 1 case per 2 million individuals. The average age at the time of diagnosis is most frequently reported between 50-55. While most studies have reported that men and women are affected in equal numbers, a few have suggested a slightly increased frequency in women (2-3:1). Advanced GCCs tend to present more frequently in women and 15-30% of women are initially diagnosed with an ovarian cancer. Less than 1% of GCCs are accurately diagnosed prior to surgery. Because there are no unique features of GCC on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of GCC cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study.

Patients experience reduced menstrual flow, increased cramping and abdominal pain, eventual cessation of menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), and, in many instances, infertility. Most often these symptoms are the result of severe inflammation of the lining of the uterus (endometriosis) that is caused by the development of bands of scar tissue that join parts of the walls of the uterus to one another, thus reducing the volume of the uterine cavity (intrauterine adhesions and synechiae).  Endometrial scarring and intrauterine adhesions may occur as a result of surgical scraping or cleaning of tissue from the uterine wall (dilatation and curettage [D and C]), infections of the endometrium (e.g., tuberculosis), or other factors. Asherman’s syndrome is limited to females. Unless the physician is careful, the diagnosis of Asherman's syndrome may be needlessly overlooked. A simple X-ray of the uterus with a small tube placed in the cervix is usually diagnostic. However, many physicians will, in order to save time, use a small balloon catheter placed in the uterus.

As a result, areas of narrowing (stenosis), aneurysms, or tears (dissection) may occur. If narrowing or a tear causes a decrease in blood flow through the artery, symptoms may result. FMD is most commonly found in the arteries that supply the kidneys with blood (renal arteries) and the arteries called the carotid and vertebral arteries which are found in the neck and supply the brain with blood. Less commonly, FMD affects the arteries in the abdomen (supplying the liver, spleen and intestines) and extremities (legs and arms). In more than one-half of people with this disease, there will be evidence of FMD in more than one artery. FMD affects women far more commonly than men, although men and children can be affected with this disease. In children with FMD, the disease seems to more commonly present with significant narrowing rather than tears of arteries and also seems to involve the arteries to the kidneys and intestines more commonly than the carotid vessels. In the pediatric population, FMD affects both boys and girls. The vascular subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV) has been associated with the most common type of fibromuscular dysplasia, known as multifocal FMD. This syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries in addition to the typical angiographic findings of fibromuscular dysplasia. There have been isolated reports of fibromuscular dysplasia associated with other disorders, including Alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Marfan syndrome, and moyamoya disease. (For more information on these disorders, search for the term in the Rare Disease Database.) In order to diagnosis FMD, a test must be done to image the blood vessels. There are many options for imaging the arteries, including specialized blood vessel ultrasound known as duplex ultrasound; a CAT scan of the arteries which is obtained after a dye is given through the veins, or a special type of MRI. In many cases, the diagnosis of FMD requires that a procedure known as an arteriogram be performed. Arteriography is a procedure that is performed by a radiologist, vascular surgeon, cardiologist, or vascular medicine specialist with appropriate training. It involves inserting a wire into or near the affected artery and injecting contrast material, a dye that can be detected by an X-ray machine. An X-ray of the affected area is then taken and examined. The individual is usually awake during an arteriogram procedure although medications may be given to keep her or him comfortable. This outpatient procedure usually lasts from one to two hours with a recovery period of up to six hours (this varies widely).\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 24\tMcCune-Albright syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 69 87\tPrecocious puberty\nT3\tSIGN 69 87\tPrecocious puberty\nT4\tANAPHOR 115 127\tThe disorder\nT5\tANAPHOR 229 241\tthe disorder\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 380 383\tMAS\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tIs_acron Arg1:T6 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\n'}, {'text': 'De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by the skin and eye symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) occurring in association with neurological abnormalities, mental retardation, unusually short stature (dwarfism), and underdevelopment of the testes or ovaries (hypogonadism).

A sequence of events occurs during which a child develops into a young adult beginning at an unexpectedly early age. Glands that secrete growth and sex hormones begin to function abnormally early in life resulting in this condition. Often, the exact cause of precocious puberty is not known. Normal puberty begins with hypothalamic production of kisspeptin, which stimulates the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in the frequency and magnitude of gonadotropin release, especially LH. Unfortunately, it is challenging to determine the initial clinical corollary to these biochemical events. It has been suggested that there is a continuum of sexual development in girls from uncomplicated premature thelarche to true precocious puberty; the former being more likely to develop in girls under 2 years of age. This spectrum exists both clinically and biochemically and emphasizes the need for the clinician to distinguish between these conditions in patients when making decisions about treatment. The criteria for diagnosis and treatment of CPP need to be reached through a synthesis of clinical findings as well as laboratory evidence for activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The gold standard for determination of pubertal gonadotropin secretion is the GnRH stimulation test, though many clinicians start with a sensitive measurement of serum LH. Skeletal age determination is frequently obtained early in the work-up, and can be helpful in distinguishing isolated signs of puberty, which do not typically cause advancement in bone age as compared to true PP, which will advance bone maturity. In boys, serum DHEAS, testosterone, 17-OH progesterone and β-HCG levels are useful for the diagnosis of GIPP. In girls, serum DHEAS, estradiol and 17-OH progesterone levels are useful. Diagnostic studies including head MRI and pelvic ultrasound are frequently required in the work-up of children with PP.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 27\tErythrokeratolysis hiemalis\nT2\tSKINRAREDISEASE 57 67\tichthyosis\nT3\tANAPHOR 225 237\tThe disorder\nT4\tSIGN 283 295;314 359\terythematous distributed equally on both sides of the body\nT5\tANAPHOR 446 458\tThe disorder\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 504 531\tErythrokeratolysis hiemalis\nT7\tSIGN 552 588\tperiodic attacks of red skin plaques\nT8\tSIGN 637 644\tplaques\nT9\tSIGN 694 701\tplaques\nT10\tANAPHOR 777 789\tthe disorder\nT11\tANAPHOR 910 922\tthe disorder\nT12\tSIGN 1011 1018\tplaques\nT13\tSIGN 1042 1047\tfever\nT14\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1060 1087\tErythrokeratolysis hiemalis\nT15\tANAPHOR 1176 1189\tThis disorder\nT16\tANAPHOR 1262 1264\tIt\nT17\tANAPHOR 1358 1371\tthis disorder\nT18\tSIGN 1556 1571\tscaly, dry skin\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T80\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tAnaphora Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tAnaphora Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tAnaphora Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\n'}, {'text': 'STWS has a very low prevalence of <1 out of 1,000,000.

It is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid sulfatase. Under normal conditions, this enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) cholesterol sulfate, a member of the chemical family of steroids. Cholesterol sulfate plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the skin. If steroid metabolism is interrupted and cholesterol sulfate accumulates in the skin cells, the skin cells stick together more strongly than usual. The normal shedding of dead skin cells is inhibited and the skin cells build up and clump into scales. X-linked recessive disorders are conditions that are coded on the X chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.  Therefore, in females, the normal gene on one X chromosome can mask disease traits on the other X chromosome.  Since males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit the gene for a disease present on the X they will express the disease.  Men with X-linked disorders transmit the gene to all their daughters, who are carriers, but never to their sons.  Women who are carriers of an X-linked disorder have a 50 percent chance of transmitting the carrier condition to their daughters and a 50 percent risk of transmitting the disease to their sons.

In 2008, the most recent published data from the National Vital Statistics System indicated that SIDS was listed as the third leading cause of death in infants in the United States. Causes of SIDS are considered to be multifactorial. The triple risk hypothesis describes the presence of three risk factors that, when overlapping, predispose a baby to SIDS. These include an environmental trigger/stress, a critical developmental period, and an underlying vulnerability. Physician-scientists and scientists are studying neuropathological tissue and genetic material from SIDS victims to ascertain factors that might be responsible for heightening an infant’s vulnerability to SIDS. Others are performing physiologic studies on infants known to have an increased risk for SIDS. Basic scientists are studying animal models that might provide insight into mechanisms responsible for SIDS. Current clinical management targets improving education for families and caregivers regarding known modifiable environmental stressors (risk factors) (see below). There are typically no symptoms prior to a SIDS death. Though SIDS occurs during sleep, the deaths may occur during day or night time sleep. Existing literature does not indicate any evidence for suffering by the infant in the moments preceding the sudden death. SIDS can affect all infants under 1 year of age. Most deaths occur less than 6 months of age with the peak affected age between 2 and 4 months. Gender, ethnic and racial differences also exist. For example, boys are at greater risk for SIDS than girls. Also, the SIDS rate in African American infants is 2.7 times greater than the Caucasian rate in the US.

These disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked congenital neutropenia. The WAS gene abnormality results in a deficiency in the WASP protein that leads to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  WAS-related disorders usually present in infancy and are characterized by bloody diarrhea, recurrent infections, scaling, itchy, skin rashes (eczema), and the appearance of small purple spots on the skin (petechia). The development of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and intracranial bleeding are possible early, life-threatening complications. Later potential complications include destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), arthritis, vasculitis and kidney and liver damage.  Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing lymphomas, especially after exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. WAS-related disorders are extremely variable, even in individuals in the same family. The estimated prevalence of WAS-related disorders is 3/1,000,000 males.  This condition has been described in many ethnic groups and in many countries. A WAS-related disorder is suspected based on clinical features and laboratory testing.  Testing shows a low platelet count and small platelet size, and sometimes shows abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins: low IgM, elevated IgA and IgE, decreased absolute numbers of CD8+ T cells and decreased function of natural killer cells. Decreased or absent WASP protein in blood cells strengthens the diagnosis.

Affected individuals may also have small, fixed facial features and various abnormalities of the eyes, some of which may cause impaired vision. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from person to person. Two types of the disorder have been identified that may be differentiated by age of onset and other factors. SJS type 1, which is considered the classical form of the disorder, may become apparent during early to late infancy or childhood. SJS type 2, a more rare form of the disorder, is typically recognized at birth (congenital). Most researchers now believe that SJS type 2 is actually the same disorder as Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome and not a form of SJS.

Measles is caused by a paramyxovirus.  The disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted from four days before the rash begins.  The virus lives in the mucus in the nose and throat of an infected person and is spread into the air when the infected person sneezes or coughs. Measles affects males and females equally and occurs worldwide.   As a result of vaccination to prevent measles, all cases that now occur in the United States have been brought from other countries.   Measles continues to be a significant public health problem in developing countries, with 30-40 million cases per year.  Most reported cases are from Africa. Measles is diagnosed by physical findings.

Plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell, are produced in the bone marrow and normally reside there. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body, especially the bone marrow. If only a single tumor is present, the term solitary plasmacytoma is used. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells, the term multiple myeloma is used. Plasma cells are a key component of the immune system and secrete a substance known as immunoglobulin proteins (M-proteins), a type of antibody. Antibodies are special proteins that the body produces to combat invading microorganisms, toxins, or other foreign substances. Overproduction of plasma cells in affected individuals results in abnormally high levels of these proteins within the body, referred to as M proteins. Major symptoms of multiple myeloma may include bone pain, especially in the back and the ribs; low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia) resulting in weakness, fatigue, and lack of color (pallor); and kidney (renal) abnormalities.

The number of new cases in the United States annually has been estimated to be 5,000-6,000. Tumors usually arise from the intestinal tract with the most common site being the stomach, followed by the small intestine, and then the colon/rectum with rare cases arising in the esophagus. There are also tumors that appear to arise in the membranous tissue lining the wall of the stomach (peritoneum) or in a fold of such membranous tissue (the omentum). There are also case reports of tumors arising in the appendix and/or pancreas. These tumors most commonly present with abdominal pain, bleeding or signs of intestinal obstruction. They spread most commonly to sites within the abdominal cavity and to the liver, although there are rare cases of spread to the lungs and bone. Some GISTs are noncancerous (benign) and do not spread (indolent); others are aggressive with extensive local invasion as well as distant metastases. Most cases result from a change (mutation) in one of two genes, KIT or PDGFR, which leads to continued growth and division of tumor cells. There are a few reported cases of families in which a gene mutation is inherited; however, the majority of tumors occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically) and not inherited (acquired mutation). Most cases arise in older adults. Leiomyosarcomas of the intestinal tract arise in a similar location and can be confused with GIST. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. There are essentially two types of muscles in the body – voluntary and involuntary. Smooth muscles are involuntary muscles – the brain has no conscious control over them. Smooth muscles react involuntarily in response to various stimuli. For example, smooth muscle that lines the walls of the digestive tract causes wave-like contractions (peristalsis) that aid in the digestion and transport of food. Smooth muscles in the salivary glands cause the glands to squirt saliva into the mouth in response to taking a bite of food. Smooth muscle in the skin causes goose bumps to form in response to cold. Leiomyosarcoma usually spreads via the bloodstream. It is very rare to see it in lymphatics. Since smooth muscle is found all over the body, a leiomyosarcoma can form almost anywhere where there are blood vessels, heart, liver, pancreas, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract, the space behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneum), uterus, skin. The uterus is the most common location for a leiomyosarcoma. Most leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract are now reclassified as GISTs. The exact cause of leiomyosarcoma, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, is unknown.

Major symptoms may include extremely wide-set eyes (ocular hypertelorism) with a broad or beaked nose, a small head (microcephaly), low-set malformed ears, growth deficiency, heart (cardiac) defects, intellectual disability, and seizures. The symptoms of this syndrome vary from person to person based the size and location of the missing piece of chromosome 4. WHS is an extremely rare disorder. Studies undertaken about 25 years ago suggested that the disorder occurred in approximately 1 in about 50,000 live births with a female to male ratio of 2:1. More recent studies suggest that the frequency of the disorder is underestimated because of misdiagnosis. A diagnosis of WHS may be suggested by the characteristic facial appearance, growth failure, developmental delays, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of a deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) by cytogenetic (chromosome) analysis.  Conventional cytogenetic analysis detects less than half of the deletions that cause WHS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a WHSCR probe has much better detection rate than standard karyotype and will detect most patients. However, the diagnostic test of choice is chromosomal microarray, which detects essentially all deletions of the WHSCR and defines the size of the deletion.

Wheezing and hemoptysis are rare. The term bronchiolitis obliterans refers to swirls or plugs of fibrous, granulation tissue filling the small bronchiole airways. Organizing pneumonia refers to organized swirls of inflammatory tissue filling the small spherical units of the lungs referred to as alveoli and the alveolar ducts. Individuals with BOOP experience inflammation of the bronchioles and alveolar lung spherical units simultaneously, which distinguishes it from other similar inflammatory lung disorders. Though the term pneumonia is used, BOOP is not an infection. In most cases, the cause of BOOP is unknown and is referred to as idiopathic BOOP. Causes of BOOP include radiation therapy; exposure to certain fumes or chemicals, exposure to birds, post respiratory infections, after organ transplantation; and from more than 35 medications. Systemic disorders associated with BOOP include the connective-tissue diseases, immunological disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease. BOOP has also been seen in association with lung abscess, lung cancer, and lymphoma. Importantly, the BOOP lesion is seen in individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and in these situations, the primary lung disease is the IPF and the secondary process is BOOP. BOOP affects males and females in equal numbers. It develops in individuals between 40-60 years old, but the disorder may affect individuals of any age. BOOP is estimated to account for 5 to 10% of the chronic infiltrative lung disease in the United States. BOOP has been reported throughout the world. A diagnosis of BOOP may be made based upon a clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized tests such as x-ray studies, especially a high-resolution chest computed tomography or HRCT, pulmonary function studies that includes a diffusing capacity test, and often a lung biopsy for microscopic tissue analysis. Lung biopsy may be via conventional transbronchial biopsy which frequently captures the diagnosis, transbronchial cryobiopsy which is newer and recovers a larger bit of tissue or in selected cases, open lung biopsy. The HRCT scan shows “ground glass” densities that are often triangular in shape with the base of the triangle along the chest wall and the airways can often be seen in the ground-glass opacities.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 25\tWeill Marchesani syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 36 73\tgenetic disorder of connective tissue\nT3\tSIGN 91 127\tabnormalities of the lens of the eye\nT4\tSIGN 129 142\tshort stature\nT5\tSIGN 176 189\tbrachycephaly\nT6\tSIGN 195 210\tjoint stiffness\nT7\tSIGN 216 219;229 242\teye abnormalities\nT8\tSIGN 275 292\tmicrospherophakia\nT9\tSIGN 326 340\tectopia lentis\nT10\tDISEASE 359 365\tmyopia\nT11\tSIGN 359 365\tmyopia\nT12\tSIGN 386 420\tabnormal shape of the eye and lens\nT13\tDISEASE 467 475\tglaucoma\nT14\tSIGN 467 475\tglaucoma\nT15\tSIGN 494 503\tblindness\nT16\tSIGN 505 518\tHeart defects\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 561 586\tWeill Marchesani syndrome\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 650 675\tWeill Marchesani syndrome\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T30\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T110\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T16\t\n'}, {'text': 'Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of certain muscles.

The presence of RA gives rise to painful, stiff and swollen joints. A low white blood cell count, especially when accompanied by an abnormally large spleen, leads to a greater chance for infections. Other symptoms associated with Felty syndrome may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and/or discoloration of patches of skin (brown pigmentation). The exact cause of Felty syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be an autoimmune disorder that may be genetically transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis are affected by Felty syndrome.  This is a large number, but most of these go undiagnosed.  The disorder is about three times more common in women than in men.  Felty syndrome is not found as frequently among those of African descent as among Caucasian populations. The disorder generally affects persons 50 to 70 years of age.

It is characterized by the narrowing (stenosis) and/or closing (occlusion) of the carotid artery inside the skull, a major artery that delivers blood to the brain. At the same time, tiny blood vessels at the base of the brain open up in an apparent attempt to supply blood to the brain distal to the blockage. These tiny vessels are the ""moyamoya"" vessels for which the disease was named. Inadequate blood supply then leads to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain, and it is this oxygen deprivation that causes the signs of moyamoya. One of the symptoms is typically stroke, which results in paralysis of the face, arms or legs, loss of speech, etc., or temporary loss of neurologic function of body parts or speech (transient ischemic attacks, or “TIA”). Other symptoms that may result include headaches, visual disturbances, developmental delay, and seizures. Approximately 10% of cases of moyamoya in Asian countries have a genetic cause. Patients with this arteriopathy that occurs either on a familial or idiopathic basis are said to have moyamoya disease. Patients in whom the artery changes occur in association with another process such as sickle cell disease or Down syndrome are said to have moyamoya disease. In this report, we use the term ""moyamoya disease"" as shorthand for both forms. In Japan, moyamoya disease typically occurs in females under the age of 20. In Japan, the disease is estimated to occur in 1 per 300,000 people. Although moyamoya was originally reported in individuals of Japanese ancestry, cases have been reported from elsewhere in Asia as well as from Europe, North and South America, and most series reported in the western hemisphere have a minority of patients of Asian descent.  Of note, most patients in North America are isolated cases, with recent literature suggesting that less than 4% of cases in this population are familial. (Gaillard 2017) In most patients, the diagnosis of moyamoya can be made from a careful assessment of an MRI and MRA. Cerebral arteriography will confirm the diagnosis, establish the exact degree of blood vessel narrowing, demonstrate the existing blood flow patterns to various areas of the brain, and allow treatment decisions to be made; for these reasons, it is the standard diagnostic tool for this condition. In particular, catheter angiography can help with the identification of important blood vessels called “transdural collaterals,” which are present in some cases and can markedly influence surgical planning and prognosis.

It is a form of inflammation of the small blood vessels (vasculitis) and is characterized by painful, itchy, tender, skin lesions on the lower legs, hands, toes, feet, ears and face. The lesions usually last for two to three weeks. One form of the disorder affects the blood vessels of the thighs. The exact cause of perniosis is unclear.  Cold weather causes the small veins and arteries close to the skin to tighten or constrict.  When the tissues are rewarmed, blood leaks into the tissue and causes the skin to swell.  The swelling irritates the nerves, and pain is the result.  It is thought by some that the disorder may represent an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the cold.  Prolonged exposure to the cold, insufficient protective clothing, and circulatory or cardiovascular diseases may also be causative factors.  Some cases are believed to be caused by genetic factors.  Other suspected causes include nutrition, local infection, hormonal changes, and other systemic diseases. Perniosis is seen more often in females than in males.  Also, it is seen more often in women who are very thin.  Several articles in the medical literature focus on cases of perniosis in anorexic women.

Most pheochromocytomas originate in one of the two adrenal glands located above the kidneys in the back of the upper abdomen. Most chromaffin cells are found in the adrenal gland's inner layer, which is known as the adrenal medulla. Approximately 90 percent of pheochromocytomas occur in the adrenal medulla. Approximately 10 percent occur outside of this area. These cases are referred to as extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. Paragangliomas may be found in the chest, heart, bladder, and/or neck or base of the skull. Symptoms associated with pheochromocytomas include high blood pressure (hypertension), headaches, excessive sweating, and/or heart palpitations. In most cases, pheochromocytomas occur randomly, for unknown reasons (sporadically). In approximately 25 to 35 percent of cases, pheochromocytomas may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Some inherited cases may occur as part of a larger disorder such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2a and 2b, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis or familial paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3 or 4, or as familial isolated pheochromocytoma. Many different disorders and conditions share similar symptoms with pheochromocytomas especially neurogenic hypertension. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis. Thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, anxiety or panic attacks, hyperthyroidism, adrenal medullary hyperplasia, familial dysautonomia, and intracranial lesions may also have similar symptoms.

The organism that causes bejel belongs to the same family as the bacterium that causes syphilis, pinta and yaws and is known as treponema. Treponemas are spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochetes). Also known as endemic syphilis, bejel is characterized by lesions of the skin and bones that begin in the mouth and progress in gradual stages. The late stages are the most severe. Bejel is a rare infectious disease caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete), known as Treponema pallidum endemicum. Under a microscope, T. p. endemicum is virtually indistinguishable from Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The disease is not sexually transmitted. The diagnosis of bejel is based on the geographic history of the patient as well as laboratory testing of material from the lesions (darkfield examination). The responsible bacterium is readily identifiable on sight in a microscope as a treponema. Samples of the fluid that surrounds the lesions yield a positive VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption) test.

Then, to prevent reimplantation of cancer cells, the abdomen is washed with a warm chemotherapy solution. This is commonly referred to hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or HIPEC. Sometimes the surgeon must search carefully for the primary appendiceal tumor for it may be very small in comparison to the mucinous tumor and mucinous ascites that can accumulate in kilogram quantities within the abdomen and pelvis.

Hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 64,300 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Of those cases, more than 49,350 will occur in women.

In general, thyroid nodules in children and adolescents are more likely may be malignant than those that occur in adults. In general, for unclear reasons, the rate of thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Some researchers believe that this increase in frequency is due to the greater use of imaging (CT scans, MRI), with the result being an increase in the rate of detection of small thyroid cancers that may not ever have been detected while the individual was alive.

SSCD has been implicated as the cause of a variety of inner ear symptoms including Tullio's phenomenon, pressure induced vertigo, aural fullness, autophony, conductive hearing loss, and fluctuating or progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, SSCD has also been reported to be asymptomatic. In the past, many patients with SSCD had been misdiagnosed as having otosclerosis, patulous eustachian tubes, middle ear perilymphatic fistulas, or Ménière’s disease. Identification of this entity requires a high degree of suspicion, appropriate findings on physical exam, lab testing, and confirmation on high-resolution CT scan. Surgical repair of the SSCD or occlusion of the superior canal has been reported with a high degree of symptom resolution. SSCD has been labelled the “great otologic mimicker” because it can simulate the symptoms of so many other ear disorders. However, the most common symptoms are vertigo/dizziness elicited by pressure altering activity, Tullio’s phenomenon (sound-induced vertigo), fullness/pressure in the ear and autophony.  Autophony is hearing internal noises louder than would be expected, such as hearing your eyes move/blink, heart beat or joint movements. Hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss can occur, mimicking otosclerosis or Meniere’s disease. Fullness in the ear and hearing your breathing loudly in the ear are symptoms of patulous eustachian tube, but can also be found with SSCD.  Finally, most patients with the anatomic defect of superior semicircular canal dehiscence have no symptoms at all for some time prior to developing symptoms. SSCD can affect all age groups. There are no studies looking at the demographics of SSCD, however, the vast majority of patients diagnosed with SSCD are adults. Although the incidence of finding SSCD on a scan is the same for adults and children, the incidence of symptomatic SSCD in children is much less. Dehiscence of bone in other parts of the otic capsule can produce similar syndromes, although they are much less common. Other locations include the posterior semicircular canal, the horizontal semicircular canal and cochlea. Posterior semicircular canal dehiscence is often due to a high riding jugular bulb but can also been seen with anomalies of the vestibular aqueduct, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS). EVAS, by itself can also produce symptoms similar to SSCD. Horizontal semicircular canal dehiscence is most frequently the result of an eroding process such as cholesteatoma. The cochlea can have bony dehiscence where it abuts the carotid artery and at the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve. Lastly, the bony opening where the hearing nerve enters the cochlea (at the internal auditory canal) can be abnormally wide, resulting in symptoms similar to SSCD. Because the condition of SSCD is still fairly new (identified in 1998), it could be argued that all treatments are considered experimental or investigational.  However, the most frequently employed are surgical. Surgery for SSCD has included resurfacing the defect with a variety of materials, plugging the superior semicircular canal, and a combination of resurfacing and plugging. These techniques can be done through a transmastoid or a middle fossa craniotomy approach. These techniques have found great success in reducing or eliminating the vestibular symptoms of SSCD. These techniques are also effective in reducing or eliminating autophony but they have not been effective in improving hearing. A lesser approach that seems to give similar benefits is reinforcement of the middle ear windows. This surgery has the advantage of being a more minimally invasive procedure but the success rate seems to be much lower with a higher recurrence rate in the long term.\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 1 21\tRoussy-Lévy Syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 37 66\thereditary areflexic dystasia\nT3\tDISEASE 78 108\tgenetic neuromuscular disorder\nT4\tANAPHOR 165 177\tThe disorder\nT5\tSIGN 198 212\tincoordination\nT6\tSIGN 242 256\tsensory ataxia\nT7\tSIGN 284 293;295 312\tareflexia of the lower legs\nT8\tSIGN 284 293;295 297;330 339\tareflexia of the hands\nT9\tSIGN 341 349;377 405\tweakness of muscles of the lower legs\nT10\tSIGN 368 375;377 405\tatrophy of muscles of the lower legs\nT11\tSIGN 418 466\thigh arches of the feet with increased extension\nT12\tSIGN 480 489\tpes cavus\nT13\tSIGN 495 503\tclawfoot\nT14\tSIGN 512 532\ttremors of the hands\nT15\tSIGN 633 647\tkyphoscoliosis\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 670 690\tRoussy-Lévy Syndrome\nT17\tSIGN 779 790\tdenervation\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 793 813\tRoussy-Levy Syndrome\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 879 899\tRoussy-Lévy Syndrome\nT20\tDISEASE 921 958\thereditary motor sensory neuropathies\nT21\tSIGN 976 984;997 1015\tweakness of the leg muscles\nT22\tSIGN 989 1015\tatrophy of the leg muscles\nT23\tSIGN 1004 1015;1026 1041\tleg muscles loss of feeling\nT24\tANAPHOR 1056 1069\tthis syndrome\nT25\tSIGN 1075 1093\tdifficulty walking\nT26\tSIGN 1100 1116\tlack of reflexes\nT27\tSIGN 1152 1161\tpes cavus\nT28\tRAREDISEASE 1164 1175\tRoussy-Lévy\nT29\tDISEASE 1205 1242\thereditary motor sensory neuropathies\nT30\tANAPHOR 1278 1290\tthe disorder\nT31\tRAREDISEASE 1344 1355\tRoussy-Lévy\nT32\tSIGN 1397 1423\tslight tremor in the hands\nT33\tRAREDISEASE 1425 1436\tRoussy-Lévy\nT34\tRAREDISEASE 1544 1564\tRoussy-Lévy Syndrome\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tIs_synon Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T70\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T11\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T14\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T15\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR16\tIs_a Arg1:T30 Arg2:T31\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T30 Arg2:T32\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T30 Arg2:T48\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T30 Arg2:T49\t\nR20\tAnaphora Arg1:T30 Arg2:T47\t\nR21\tProduces Arg1:T24 Arg2:T25\t\nR22\tProduces Arg1:T24 Arg2:T26\t\nR23\tProduces Arg1:T24 Arg2:T27\t\nR24\tIs_a Arg1:T28 Arg2:T29\t\nR25\tAnaphora Arg1:T28 Arg2:T30\t\nR26\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T32\t\n'}, {'text': 'Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mental retardation; abnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area; large, soft hands with short, thin (tapered) fingers; short stature; and/or various skeletal abnormalities.

Craniofacial abnormalities may consist of characteristic facial features that cause the individual to appear to be whistling. These features include an extremely small puckered mouth (microstomia); a ""full"" forehead appearance, unusually prominent cheeks; and thin, pursed lips. Affected infants may also have an unusually flat middle portion of the face, a high roof of the mouth (palate), an unusually small jaw (micrognathia), an abnormally small tongue (microglossia), and/or a raised, scar-like mark in the shape of an ""H"" or a ""V"" extending from the lower lip to the chin. Affected infants often have abnormalities affecting the eyes including widely-spaced deep-set eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Malformations of the hands and feet are also characteristic of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Children with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome may also exhibit speech impairment; swallowing and eating difficulties; vomiting; failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and/or respiratory problems that may result in life-threatening complications. Freeman-Sheldon syndrome can be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. However, most cases occur randomly with no apparent cause (sporadically). Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was first described in 1938 by Drs. Freeman and Sheldon. Some cases occurred within families (kindreds) over several generations. Some symptoms and physical findings associated with the disorder are apparent at birth (congenital). Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is one of a group of disorders that are associated with multiple congenital contractures (MCCs). MCCs occur in approximately 1 in 3,000 children.

Affected children have a “gestalt” consisting of facial dysmorphism with a prominent lower lip, an asthenic build, low muscle mass, kyphoscohosis and speech abnormalities. Males with SRS have low muscle tone (hypotonia) at birth. Symptoms appear early, especially the facial features. Developmental milestones are also not met early in life. The developmental delay progresses such that many boys with SRS have some motor disability. Osteoporosis develops which can result in numerous fractures without a causative event. Seizures are not common and severity varies. Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare X-linked intellectual disability disorder and as such it is difficult to estimate its prevalence.

Retinoblastoma affects males slightly more often than females. The incidence in the United States and Europe is estimated to be 2-5 children per 1,000,000 people in the general population. The age-adjusted annual incidence for children aged 0-4 in the United States is 10-14 children per 1,000,000. This equates to about 1 in 14,000-18,000 live births. Incidence is the number of newly diagnosed people with a disorder identified in a given year. Two-thirds of children are affected before the age of 2 and more than 90% of retinoblastomas become apparent before the age of five years. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, the identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of specialized tests. The presenting symptom is usually leukocoria. A complete examination of the interior of the eye (fundoscopic examination under anesthesia – EUA) may be performed to locate the presence of a tumor or tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) may be used to determine the extent of the tumor(s) and determine if the tumor has spread to surrounding structures or tissue. Ultrasonography may be used to rule out other conditions. Computed tomography (CT) scans are generally avoided because of the potential risk of additional radiation-induced tumors if the child has hereditary retinoblastoma.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 7\tMPS III\nT2\tSKINRAREDISEASE 117 125\tMPS IIIA\nT3\tSKINRAREDISEASE 117 124;211 217\tMPS III type B\nT4\tANAPHOR 273 279\ttype B\nT5\tANAPHOR 273 277;321 322\ttype A\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 324 332\tMPS IIIC\nT7\tSKINRAREDISEASE 324 327;337 341\tMPS IIID\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T2 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tIs_a Arg1:T3 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tIs_a Arg1:T6 Arg2:T1\t\nR6\tIs_a Arg1:T7 Arg2:T1\t\n'}, {'text': '"Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare multi-system disorder characterized by widespread inflammation, weakening, and damage to small and medium-sized arteries.

When first described, this disorder was thought to involve only adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and thyroid insufficiency (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). However, over time, as more patients were studied, the scope of the disorder was expanded to include disorders of other underperforming endocrine glands. These include the gonads, which secrete sex hormones; the pancreas which secretes insulin and is intimately tied up with diabetes mellitus; and sometimes the parathyroid glands. Failure of the endocrine glands to function is usually accompanied by signs of malnutrition because the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb nutrients is reduced dramatically.  Since the combination of affected glands differs from patient to patient, the signs of this disorder are diverse. The exact cause of AIPS-II is not known, but it is thought to result from one or more abnormal immune responses.  Autoimmune reactions occur when, for reasons not quite clear, the body mistakenly reacts to a normal antibody as if it were a foreign one. Report suggest that the prevalence of AIPS-II is about 14 to 20 cases per million of population and that it affects females 3 to 4 times as often as it does males.  AIPS-II usually strikes in the third or fourth decade of life. Each disorder in a case of autoimmune polyendocrine type II is treated separately.

The teeth lack pulp chambers or have half-moon shaped pulp chambers in short or abnormally shaped roots. The condition may affect juvenile as well as adult teeth and, since the roots are abnormally short, usually leads to the premature loss of teeth.  The color of the teeth is usually normal.

These include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), nephronophthisis (NPHP) chronic tubulointerstitial disease, and others. Typical liver abnormalities include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), increased pressure in the venous system that carries blood from different organs to the liver (portal hypertension), and fiber-like connective tissue that spreads over and through the liver (hepatic fibrosis). Gastrointestinal (stomach and intestine) bleeding, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and hypersplenism (decreased platelet and other blood counts due to enlarged spleen) may be early signs of this condition. The frequency of CHF is not known. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1/10,000 -20,000 based on the prevalence of ciliopathies that are associated with CHF. CHF is diagnosed by ultrasound exam and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and kidneys, and rarely, by liver biopsy.

Menetrier disease may be suspected in individuals with large gastric folds. Large gastric folds may be diagnosed by a radiologic study after the patient drinks a barium solution or by an endoscopic exam, a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and used to examine the interior of the stomach and, if necessary, to obtain tissue samples for microscopic study (biopsy).

The disease may be characterized by a high fever, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat, a reddish skin rash, and swelling of lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). In addition, individuals with Kawasaki disease may develop inflammation of arteries that transport blood to heart muscle (coronary arteritis), associated widening or bulging (aneurysms) of the walls of affected coronary arteries, inflammation of heart muscle (myocarditis), and/or other symptoms and findings. Kawasaki disease is the primary cause of acquired heart disease in children in the United States. Although the cause of the disease is unknown, it is widely thought to be due to infection or an abnormal immune response to infection. Kawasaki disease most frequently affects children five years of age or younger. In extremely rare cases, Kawasaki disease may occur during adolescence or adulthood. First reported in Japanese children in the 1960s, the disease is now recognized worldwide and occurs in individuals in all racial and ethnic groups. However, Kawasaki disease appears to affect Asian children most frequently. Estimates indicate that at least 3,000 cases of Kawasaki disease are diagnosed each year in the United States.

Affected individuals may also exhibit a mild delay in physical development (growth retardation); short fingers and/or toes; and/or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the two long folds of skin on either side of the vaginal opening (labia majora) in females. In addition, there may be an abnormal opening between the two large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart (pulmonary artery and aorta), causing inappropriate recirculation of some blood through the lungs, rather than throughout the rest of the body (patent ductus arteriosus). In some cases, mild mental retardation may also be present. It is believed that Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that is apparent at birth (congenital). Approximately four cases have been reported in the medical literature. Although all reported cases have involved females, the true ratio of affected females to males is not known. The first case of Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome was reported in the medical literature in 1960. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be diagnosed at birth, based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. The presence of patent ductus arteriosus occurring in association with Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome may be determined by a variety of tests. When an abnormal heart murmur is detected, chest X-rays may be ordered along with an electrocardiogram (ECG), a test that measures the heart muscle's electrical activity. Structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and its blood vessels can be analyzed through the reflection of sound waves (echocardiogram). Conductive hearing loss occurring in association with Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome can be diagnosed by a battery of tests that measures the functioning of the middle ear (conductive loss battery).\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 14\tRefsum disease\nT2\tDISEASE 37 54\tgenetic disorders\nT3\tDISEASE 68 84\tleukodystrophies\nT4\tSIGN 119 149\tdisruption of lipid metabolism\nT5\tSIGN 155 168;221 234\tmyelin sheath fails to grow\nT6\tANAPHOR 236 238\tIt\nT7\tANAPHOR 285 287\tIt\nT8\tDISEASE 336 356\tretinitis pigmentosa\nT9\tSIGN 336 356\tretinitis pigmentosa\nT10\tDISEASE 387 408\tperipheral neuropathy\nT11\tSIGN 387 408\tperipheral neuropathy\nT12\tDISEASE 443 449\tataxia\nT13\tSIGN 443 449\tataxia\nT14\tSIGN 480 490\tichthyosis\nT15\tSKINRAREDISEASE 513 527\tRefsum disease\nT16\tANAPHOR 545 547\tIt\nT17\tSIGN 738 769\tphytanic acid in blood or urine\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tIs_a Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T3\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\n'}, {'text': 'Fraser syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by partial webbing of the fingers and/or toes (partial syndactyly), kidney (renal) abnormalities, genital malformations, and/or, in some cases, complete fusion of the eyelids (cryptophthalmos) that may be associated with malformation of the eyes, causing blindness. In infants with Fraser syndrome, renal malformations may include improper development (dysplasia), underdevelopment (hypoplasia), or absence of one or both kidneys (unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis).

Infected water fleas release the larvae of the worm into drinking water. Ingestion of contaminated water causes the larvae to migrate from the intestines via the abdominal cavity to the tissue under the skin. The larvae mature and release a toxic substance that makes the overlying skin ulcerate. After treatment, symptoms disappear and the worms can be safely removed from the skin. Dracunculosis is characterized by chronic skin ulcers.  Tissue under the skin is infiltrated by developing larvae of the parasitic worm known as Dracunculus medinensis, or Guinea worm.  A female worm ready to release larvae produces stinging elevated spots (papules), causing redness and itching of the skin.  These symptoms may be an allergic reaction to the parasite.  The spots form blisters and later rupture, developing into painful ulcers.  Multiple ulcers (usually on the legs) are common.  Without treatment, the worms are absorbed or protrude from the skin over a period of several weeks. The cause of dracunculosis is the consumption of water contaminated by the larvae of the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis, which live in an intermediate host in the water.  The larvae are released from the intermediate host while in the stomach, where they mate and grow.  This stage lasts for as long as a year.  The female apparently survives this process and may grow to three feet in length.  The symptoms and characteristic ulcers and infections occur when the female moves from the stomach or intestine to tissues under the skin. In 1986, there were approximately 3.2 million cases of dracunculosis worldwide.  However, due to the efforts of several national and international organizations in cooperation with local governments, the incidence of the disease has significantly decreased.  According to current estimates, there are now fewer than 100,000 cases of dracunculosis worldwide, with the remaining cases primarily occurring in Sudan and certain countries in West Africa, such as Nigeria and Niger. In individuals with dracunculosis, the condition is diagnosed based upon characteristic symptoms (e.g., fever, pain, and blistering and ulceration of the affected area) in association with the emergence of the adult worm through the individual's skin.\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 13\tSyringobulbia\nT2\tDISEASE 19 40\tneurological disorder\nT3\tSIGN 151 158;81 87;89 99\tmedulla syrinx within the\nT4\tANAPHOR 161 163\tIt\nT5\tANAPHOR 415 428\tThis disorder\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 459 472\tsyringomyelia\nT7\tSIGN 487 523\tsyrinx is limited to the spinal cord\nT8\tSIGN 536 557\tChiari I malformation\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 572 585\tSyringobulbia\nT10\tANAPHOR 599 611\tThe disorder\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 643 656\tSyringobulbia\nT12\tANAPHOR 691 693\tIt\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 865 878\tsyringobulbia\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T40\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\n'}, {'text': 'Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is a rare disorder that can strike persons whose immune system is deficient or suppressed and who have received a bone marrow transplant or a nonirradiated blood transfusion.

When receiving the bone marrow or stem cell transplant, immunocompetent donor lymphocytes recognize foreign minor locus histocompatibility antigens on the recipient’s cells resulting in GVHD. GVHD affects males and females of all ages who have been immunosuppressed before being given a bone marrow transplant or a nonirradiated blood transfusion containing allogeneic lymphocytes.

Symptoms associated with Nelson syndrome include intense skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation), headaches, vision impairment, and the cessation of menstrual periods in women. Symptoms of Nelson syndrome include intense skin pigmentation, headaches, visual field disturbances and the cessation of menstrual periods in females. Blood levels of the pituitary hormones adrenocorticotrope hormone (ACTH) and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) are abnormally high.  The pituitary gland gets abnormally large in Nelson syndrome, causing headaches and visceral symptoms. Nelson syndrome can be caused by surgical removal of the adrenal glands on both sides of the body (bilateral adrenalectomy).  Removal of the adrenal glands is a treatment for Cushing disease.  Cushing disease is the name given to a condition in which Cushing syndrome, an endocrine disorder, occurs because of the presence of benign (non-cancerous) tumors on the pituitary gland.  Following removal of these adrenal glands, some people will develop Nelson syndrome.  Growth of a pre-existing or a concealed (occult) tumor of the pituitary gland may also cause this disorder. Nelson syndrome affects approximately 15 to 25% of people who have undergone surgical removal of their adrenal glands.  It affects males and females in equal numbers.  Cases caused by tumors are very rare. When Nelson syndrome is suspected, blood samples are analyzed for the presence or absence of cortisol and/or aldosterone.

Some studies have suggested risk factors such as smoking and dietary intake, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. In the majority of cases tumors are slow-growing and can produce hormonal chemical substances such as serotonin, bradykinins, tachykinins and prostaglandins. If the original carcinoid cells spread (metastasize) to the liver, these substances are no longer broken down to their inactive form and are released into the systemic (main) circulation, causing the signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. When tumors affect organs other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as the ovaries, carcinoid syndrome can occur in the absence of liver metastases. Carcinoid tumors are rare, with only 27 new cases per million diagnosed in the U.S. per year. Of these, only about 10% will develop carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. All races can be affected though there is a slightly increased prevalence in black African males. All ages can be affected but most gastrointestinal cases occur in middle-age. Bronchial (airway) tumors are most often seen in the fifth decade but can affect people at any age. Carcinoid syndrome may be more prevalent than suspected because diagnosis is difficult and sometimes overlooked; some patients may not exhibit all three of the hallmark symptoms of flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is best achieved with a multimodality approach including biochemical investigation, radiological and nuclear imaging, and finally histological (tissue biopsy) confirmation where possible. The occurrence of episodic facial flushing and/or chronic diarrhea not diagnosed by standard tests as being a result of more common causes should lead to suspicion of carcinoid syndrome. In the past, measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyendolacetic acid (5-HIAA), a product of the breakdown (metabolism) of serotonin, in a patient on a low serotonin diet was the main lab test used. It is still useful and the level of 5-HIAA will be clearly elevated in 50% of the cases. However, there are also blood tests available, the most useful being chromogranin-A, often in combination with an imaging technique known as octreoscan, that may confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome even when urinary 5-HIAA is normal. This technique may also be helpful in indicating the presence of carcinoid tumors when the full spectrum of symptoms is not apparent. Other investigations that may be helpful, depending on the location of the primary tumor, include CT scan, ultrasound, MRI and endoscopy. Sometimes the diagnosis is established incidentally at the time of surgery for another suspected condition such as intestinal obstruction or appendicitis.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 14\tMenkes disease\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 20 57\tgenetic disorder of copper metabolism\nT3\tANAPHOR 218 220\tIt\nT4\tSIGN 241 249\tseizures\nT5\tDISEASE 251 269\tmental retardation\nT6\tSIGN 251 269\tmental retardation\nT7\tSIGN 271 285\tstunted growth\nT8\tSIGN 287 304\tfailure to thrive\nT9\tSIGN 306 331\tunstable body temperature\nT10\tSIGN 337 375\tvery unusual color and texture of hair\nT11\tSKINRAREDISEASE 377 391\tMenkes disease\nT12\tSIGN 412 458\tbrittle, tangled, sparse, steely or kinky hair\nT13\tSIGN 454 503\thair that is often white, ivory, or gray in color\nT14\tSIGN 506 529\tUnusual facial features\nT15\tSIGN 538 550\tpudgy cheeks\nT16\tSIGN 555 572\tabnormal eyebrows\nT17\tSIGN 602 618\tborn prematurely\nT18\tSIGN 656 667\thypothermia\nT19\tSIGN 704 722\thyperbilirubinemia\nT20\tDISEASE 763 771\tjaundice\nT21\tSIGN 763 771\tjaundice\nT22\tSIGN 774 785\tHypothermia\nT23\tSIGN 943 969\tSevere developmental delay\nT24\tSIGN 971 1003\tloss of early development skills\nT25\tSIGN 1009 1020\tconvulsions\nT26\tSIGN 1033 1052\tBrain abnormalities\nT27\tSIGN 1100 1117\tsubdural hematoma\nT28\tSIGN 1126 1172\trupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain\nT29\tSIGN 1197 1213\tSpastic dementia\nT30\tSIGN 1218 1226\tseizures\nT31\tSIGN 1259 1264;1309 1318\tbones fractures\nT32\tDISEASE 1266 1278\tosteoporosis\nT33\tSIGN 1266 1278\tosteoporosis\nT34\tSIGN 1339 1356\tsubdural hematoma\nT35\tSIGN 1361 1375\tbone fractures\nT36\tSIGN 1428 1437\tEmphysema\nT37\tSIGN 1439 1460\tbladder abnormalities\nT38\tSIGN 1462 1488\tdegeneration of the retina\nT39\tSIGN 1493 1510\tcysts of the iris\nT40\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1664 1678\tMenkes disease\nT41\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1751 1765\tMenkes disease\nT42\tSIGN 1799 1818;1830 1859\tdecreased amount of ceruloplasmin in blood plasma\nT43\tSIGN 1799 1825;1844 1859\tdecreased amount of copper in blood plasma\nT44\tSIGN 2004 2021\tcopper deficiency\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T190\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T21\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T22\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T31\t\nR20\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T23\t\nR21\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T24\t\nR22\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T250\t\nR23\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T26\t\nR24\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T27\t\nR25\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T28\t\nR26\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T29\t\nR27\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T30\t\nR28\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T33\t\nR29\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T34\t\nR30\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T35\t\nR31\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T36\t\nR32\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T37\t\nR33\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T38\t\nR34\tProduces Arg1:T40 Arg2:T39\t\nR35\tProduces Arg1:T20 Arg2:T21\t\nR36\tProduces Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR37\tProduces Arg1:T20 Arg2:T45\t\n'}, {'text': 'Adult polyglucosan body disease is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal proportions.

In healthy individuals, the white blood cells produce a chemical oxidant that destroys bacteria. One blood test for diagnosis of CGD uses a molecule called dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) to determine whether or not white blood cells are making these oxidants normally. Oxidants cause the DHR to fluoresce, which is markedly reduced or absent in CGD white blood cells. This test can be performed on blood samples shipped to clinical laboratories certified to perform this test. Another blood test for CGD is called the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) slide test. In this test, NBT is mixed with the white blood cells, which are then activated to produce oxidants that react with NBT, turning it a deep blue color. If this reaction does not occur, then these important oxidants are not being produced by an individual’s white blood cells.

Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary to cause a particular disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent or can be the result of a new mutation in the affected individual. Approximately 10% of cases of HMO are thought to be the result of new mutations. At present two genes, EXT1 and EXT2, are known to show mutations in HMO patients and it is thought that these genes function as tumor suppressors. For some affected individuals no mutation in either gene is detected.  In almost all these cases, the “mutation negative” patients do not have a familial history for exostoses. Most likely, they have an EXT1 or EXT2 mutation in only part of their body cells and the mutation is absent or undetectable in blood cells, which are usually used for DNA analysis.  Data indicates that individuals with EXT1 mutations may have more severe effects than those with EXT2 mutations. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy. The risk is the same for males and females. The prevalence of HMO has been estimated to be about 1 of 50,000 live births. A high prevalence of this disorder has been reported in some isolated communities.

HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is often referred to as the “good cholesterol” as it can facilitate the removal of cholesterol out of the walls of arteries, particularly the coronary (heart) arteries. Classic features of Tangier disease include fatty accumulations that present as enlarged and yellow- or orange-colored tonsils, or enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes. Tangier disease may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, moderate elevation in triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia), nerve disturbances (neuropathy), and rarely an opaqueness in the covering of the eye (corneal clouding). This disorder was originally named after the location in which it was first discovered - Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Later, the disease was further characterized as more individuals were found to have the disease in other areas of the United States and around the globe. Symptoms of Tangier disease are variable and depend on which organs are involved and the severity of those manifestations. Tangier disease is most often characterized by enlarged orange- or yellow-colored tonsils. This discoloration is due to fatty deposits accumulating in the tonsils. Fatty deposits can also form in other organs causing enlargement of the throat, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Fat accumulations in nerves can cause disturbances and loss-of-sensation called peripheral neuropathy. Discoloration may also occur in the digestive system, particularly the rectum and large intestine. Cardiovascular disease has been reported in adults with Tangier disease. In rare cases, a clouding of the cornea of the eye can occur, but is generally mild and does not cause vision impairment. Tangier disease is a rare disorder with only approximately 100 cases diagnosed worldwide. Tangier disease is thought to be present at birth, but the age of diagnosis can be highly variable (from infancy through 7th decade) due to the nature of symptoms.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 14\tSusac syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 21 47\tautoimmune endotheliopathy\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\n'}, {'text': 'Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (TRPS3), also known as Sugio-Kajii syndrome, is an extremely rare inherited multisystem disorder.

Characteristic facial features may include a pear-shaped or rounded (bulbous) nose; an abnormally long prominent groove (philtrum) in the upper lip; and/or abnormalities such as delayed eruption of teeth. In addition, affected individuals also exhibit severe shortening of the fingers and toes (brachydactyly) due to improper development of bones in the hands and feet (metacarpophalangeal shortening).

Many affected individuals develop multiple gastrinomas, which are thought to have the potential to be cancerous (malignant). In most patients, the tumors arise within the pancreas and/or the upper region of the small intestine (duodenum). Due to excessive acid production (gastric acid hypersecretion), individuals with ZES may develop peptic ulcers of the stomach, the duodenum, and/or other regions of the digestive tract. Peptic ulcers are sores or raw areas within the digestive tract where the lining has been eroded by stomach acid and digestive juices. Symptoms and findings associated with ZES may include mild to severe abdominal pain; diarrhea; increased amounts of fat in the stools (steatorrhea); and/or other abnormalities. In most affected individuals, ZES appears to develop randomly (sporadically) for unknown reasons. In approximately 25 percent of patients, ZES occurs in association with a genetic syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). All of the tumors are considered to have malignant potential. Prognosis is related to tumor size and the presence of distant metastases. ZES may become apparent at any age. However, symptom onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 60 years. The exact frequency of ZES in the general population is unknown.

PDE is quite likely under-diagnosed and a higher birth incidence is suspected. This notion is supported by a study from a German center where pyridoxine administration is part of a standard treatment protocol for neonatal seizures and a birth incidence of probable cases of 1:20,000 was reported. While pyridoxine-dependency should be considered when evaluating possible causes of intractable seizures in young patients, other more common causes must be ruled out, including a variety of brain malformation syndromes, serious acquired disorders of the central nevous system (such as hemorrhagic conditions and infections), and other inborn errors of metabolism. A closely related neonatal metabolic epilepsy is PNPO deficiency. Babies with this genetic disorder also have intractable seizures, but the seizures in these patients respond to pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (P5P, the biologically active form of pyridoxine) but in most instances do not respond to pyridoxine.

Candidiasis is an infection caused by a fungus called Candida; most commonly the Candida albicans variety. The Candida infection (also known as a yeast infection) usually affects the skin and/or the mucous membranes of the mouth, intestines, or the vagina. Candida infections are rarely serious in otherwise healthy people. In rare cases, it may spread through other parts of the body if the patient's immune system is not functioning properly. In the most severe cases it can affect the blood, the membrane lining the heart muscle (endocardium), or membranes around the brain (meninges). Candidiasis is caused by a normally harmless infection with the yeast fungus of the genus Candida, usually Candida albicans (Monilia albicans).  The yeast is supposed to be present in healthy people.  However, the fungus may multiply in the mouth or the bowels when a patient receives chemotherapy or broad spectrum antibiotics which suppress the bacterial flora which are normally present in the body.  Other health conditions such as pregnancy or diabetes mellitus may also make the patient prone to a Candida infection. Chronic Candidiasis usually affects people who are debilitated by predisposing health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pregnancy or immune deficiencies.  Newborn babies may also be affected with the disorder through maternal infection. People with suppressed immune systems can be affected by a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and viral infections.\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 15\tNAGS deficiency\nT2\tDISEASE 184 204\turea cycle disorders\nT3\tDISEASE 260 280\turea cycle disorders\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 286 301\tNAGS deficiency\nT5\tANAPHOR 325 340\tthese disorders\nT6\tDISEASE 417 437\turea cycle disorders\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tIs_a Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\n'}, {'text': 'Introduction Both KS and nIHH are relatively rare, can affect both males and females, with a clear male predominance (~4:1). According to a recent retrospective study, to identify all diagnosed KS cases throughout Finland born during a defined time period, the minimal incidence of KS in Finland was approximately 1 in 48,000 newborns. There was a clear difference in estimates between boys (1 in 30,000) and girls (1 in 125,000). The reason for this sex ratio relates in part to the genetics and in part due to a bias of ascertainment wherein males with delayed puberty tend to seek care more frequently than do their female counterparts.

The prevalence of Joubert syndrome has been estimated to be 1/258,000 but is probably an underestimate of the true prevalence, which may be closer to 1/100,000. The diagnosis of Joubert syndrome is based on physical symptoms and the ""molar tooth sign"" as seen on an MRI.

Children with progeria usually have a normal appearance in early infancy. At approximately nine to 24 months of age, affected children begin to experience profound growth delays, resulting in short stature and low weight. They also develop a distinctive facial appearance characterized by a disproportionately small face in comparison to the head; an underdeveloped jaw (micrognathia); malformation and crowding of the teeth; abnormally prominent eyes; a small nose; prominent eyes and a subtle blueness around the mouth. In addition, by the second year of life, the scalp hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are lost (alopecia), and the scalp hair may be replaced by small, downy, white or blond hairs. Additional characteristic features include generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke, hip dislocations, unusually prominent veins of the scalp, loss of the layer of fat beneath the skin (subcutaneous adipose tissue), defects of the nails, joint stiffness, skeletal defects, and/or other abnormalities. According to reports in the medical literature, individuals with HGPS develop premature, widespread thickening and loss of elasticity of artery walls (arteriosclerosis), which result in life-threatening complications during childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Children with progeria die of heart disease (atherosclerosis) at an average age of 13 years, with a range of about eight to 21 years. As with any person suffering from heart disease, the common events as heart disease advances for children with progeria can include high blood pressure, strokes, angina (chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart itself), enlarged heart, and heart failure, all conditions associated with aging. HGPS is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females equally, and all races equally. The disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1886 (J. Hutchinson) and 1897 (H. Gilford). As of January 2014, approximately 200 cases have been reported. Estimates indicate that the prevalence of HGPS is approximately one in eighteen million, thus at any given time, there are approximately 350-400 children living with progeria worldwide.

The prevalence of NMOSD is approximately 1-10 per 100,000 individuals and seems to be similar worldwide, although somewhat higher rates have been reported in countries with a higher proportion of individuals of African ancestry. Relative to MS that it mimics, it occurs with greater frequency in individuals of Asian and African descent, but the majority of patients with this illness in Western countries are Caucasian. Individuals of any age may be affected, but typically NMOSD, especially cases seropositive for AQP4-IgG, occur in late middle-aged women. Equal numbers of men and women have the form that does not recur after the initial flurry of attacks, but women, especially those with AQP4-IgG, are four or five times more likely to be affected than men by the recurring (relapsing) form. Children represent may also be affected by this condition; children more commonly develop brain symptoms at onset and seem to have a higher frequency of monophasic presentation than adults. A diagnosis of NMOSD is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and a variety of specialized tests. Such tests include blood tests, examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), spinal taps, or x-ray procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) or computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans. A blood test, AQP4-IgG, is highly specific and moderately sensitive for NMOSD. It has been shown that it detects antibodies that are specific for an astrocyte protein, aquaporin-4. This is very helpful to request this test at the first significant suspicion of NMOSD, as it is frequently positive at the time of the very first symptom even before a confident clinical diagnosis is possible.  A recently discovered antibody, MOG-IgG, is present in about half of those who do not have AQP4-IgG; while it seems specific for a form of NMOSD, and is rarely seen in typical MS, it also occurs in some patients with recurrent optic neuritis and in some patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; in the latter patients, it is often transient.

Chronic abdominal pain is a very common condition that can have significant negative, long-term psychosocial consequences, including increased risk for anxiety, school and work absences, poor functional capacity, and a poor quality of life. While the exact cause of the pain is unknown, compression of the celiac artery and/or the celiac plexus nerves by the diaphragm can result in pain that is worsened with eating or sometimes with exercise. Other symptoms include nausea and weight loss. In some patients the symptoms can be devastating and can lead to erroneous diagnoses of an eating disorder, psychiatric conditions, or functional abdominal pain (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal migraine). The diagnosis is made based on a combination of the clinical symptoms and radiology imaging. There is a surgical procedure that can be performed that is effective in approximately 60-80% of patients. Compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament is a poorly understood vascular compression syndrome involving the celiac artery and celiac nerve plexus that results in upper abdominal pain (frequently made worse with eating), weight loss, nausea and vomiting. Sometimes a doctor may hear a soft whooshing sound with a stethoscope (bruit) over the upper abdomen that may mean there is a vascular blockage. Some patients who are athletes may experience recurrent upper abdominal pain that is brought on by moderate to intense cardiovascular work outs. Additional symptoms associated with the diagnosis, but frequently indicative of other medical problems include palpitations (hearing or feeling your own heartbeat), chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, and difficulty sleeping. The characteristic MALS patient is more likely to be young adult female, which is consistent with demographic characteristics of other chronic abdominal pain (CAP) patients.

Most new cases of HIV infection in young children (pediatric HIV infection) are caused by transmission from the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding (perinatal transmission).  Estimates suggest that the transmission rate from untreated HIV-positive mothers in the United States is approximately 12 to 30 percent. (For further information, please see the “Standard Therapies” section of this report below.)  Women with HIV infection are most often infected through heterosexual relations with an infected partner or injection drug use. Perinatal HIV infection is thought to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  As noted above, in some cases, certain dysmorphic features have been observed prior to the onset of symptoms associated with immunodeficiency.  However, the significance of such observations has been questioned (see “Symptoms”).  Symptoms and findings resulting from immunodeficiency may become apparent during the first or second year of life or later during childhood. Perinatal HIV infection is considered in infants of mothers known to be HIV-positive and/or in infants and children who have certain characteristic symptoms of HIV infection or immune system abnormalities. Infants who are born to mothers with HIV have antibodies against the virus in the bloodstream at birth (passively acquired maternal antibodies). In infants and children who are not infected with HIV, these passive antibodies eventually disappear, usually between six to 12 months, however, in some cases, they may be detectable for up to 18 months. Therefore, testing that detects the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood (serum antibody tests, e.g., enzyme immunoassay and confirmatory Western blot) in a child 18 months or older usually indicates infection; however, such testing is not conclusive in children younger than 18 months. In these children, HIV infection may be confirmed through the repeated use of various specialized viral detection laboratory tests (e.g., HIV viral cultures, a DNA-amplification and copying method known as polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). Additional laboratory tests may also be conducted to assess immune functioning in order to assist in diagnosis and to monitor disease progression and its treatment.

Epidemics can occur under crowded conditions and tend to occur at 20 to 30 year intervals.  In other parts of the world epidemics are usually caused by the Group A strain of the bacteria. During epidemics, rates of 5 to 24 cases per 100,000 persons have occurred. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, during 1974 the epidemic rate was 370 per 100,000 persons infected with Meningococcemia.

Additional cognitive defects may occur in some cases. Gerstmann syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence of Gerstmann syndrome in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Dr. Josef Gerstmann, a Viennese neurologist, in 1924. The presence in the adult of all four neurological symptoms suggests a diagnosis of Gerstmann syndrome, especially when other causes of these symptoms are ruled out. Among children, most cases are recognized at school age when the affected person has difficulty in math and writing. Affected children may also have problems in spelling, performing the basic four mathematical calculations, and distinguishing left from right. Also, they generally fail the finger identification test.

In most instances, the immediate cause of Mallory-Weiss syndrome is severe vomiting.  This can be associated with chronic alcoholism, but MWS may also result from a severe trauma to the chest or abdomen, chronic hiccups, intense snoring, lifting and straining, inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis) or esophagus (esophagitis), hiatus hernia, convulsions or CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may develop this disorder as a complication of chemotherapy. Mallory-Weiss syndrome accounts for 1 to 15% of all gastrointestinal bleeding episodes.

These nodules tend to be 1-2 centimeters large and most often affect the legs and feet (lower extremities). In most cases, idiopathic nodular panniculitis is associated with fever, a general feeling of ill health (malaise), muscle pain (myalgia), and/or abdominal pain. These symptoms may subside after a few days or weeks and may recur weeks, months, or years later. The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is not known (idiopathic). The exact cause of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is unknown. There are numerous different causes that may be associated with the development of panniculitis including gout, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, iodide or bromide therapy, withdrawal from large doses of corticosteroids, or pancreatitis. Sometimes the cause may be identified as an allergy or possibly a predisposition of fatty tissue to a granulomatous reaction. A diagnosis of idiopathic nodular panniculitis is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation, and identification of classic symptoms. In many cases, surgical removal (biopsy) and microscopic examination of small samples of deep skin tissue may reveal inflammation of subcutaneous layers of fat tissue.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 13\tWeil syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 22 41\tinfectious disorder\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 141 154\tWeil syndrome\nT4\tSIGN 175 201\tdysfunction of the kidneys\nT5\tSIGN 175 193;206 211\tdysfunction of the liver\nT6\tSIGN 248 260\thepatomegaly\nT7\tSIGN 339 347\tjaundice\nT8\tSIGN 357 385\talterations in consciousness\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 402 415\tWeil syndrome\nT10\tRAREDISEASE 478 491\tWeil syndrome\nT11\tANAPHOR 642 655\tThe infection\nT12\tANAPHOR 754 767\tThe infection\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 824 837\tWeil syndrome\nT14\tANAPHOR 910 923\tthis disorder\nT15\tANAPHOR 935 937\tIt\nT16\tDISEASE 948 969\toccupational disorder\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tAnaphora Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tIs_a Arg1:T15 Arg2:T160\t\n'}, {'text': 'Trigeminal neuralgia affects females slightly more often than males.

In follow-up examinations, approximately 15 percent of affected individuals rated their symptoms as severe. Frey syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of Frey syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a specialized test called the Minor Iodine-Starch Test. During this test, an iodine solution is applied to the affected areas of the face. Then, a starch powder such as corn starch is applied over the iodine solution.

In this setting, myocarditis is a part of a more widespread process that may require treatment with medication to suppress the immune system.\xa0 Myocarditis can also exacerbate the cardiac damage from other rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSIGN 163 179\tabsence seizures\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 181 206\tmyoclonic-atonic epilepsy\nT3\tSIGN 181 206\tmyoclonic-atonic epilepsy\nT4\tDISEASE 277 300\tintellectual disability\nT5\tSIGN 277 300\tintellectual disability\nT6\tSIGN 302 321\tSpeech difficulties\nT7\tSIGN 326 345\tbehavioral problems\nT8\tDISEASE 687 710\tintellectual disability\nT9\tSIGN 687 710\tintellectual disability\nT10\tSIGN 717 736\tlanguage impairment\nT11\tDISEASE 768 776\tEpilepsy\nT12\tSIGN 768 776\tEpilepsy\nT13\tDISEASE 869 877\tepilepsy\nT14\tSIGN 869 877\tepilepsy\nT15\tSIGN 963 975\tspeech delay\nT16\tDISEASE 999 1022\tintellectual disability\nT17\tSIGN 999 1022\tintellectual disability\nT18\tDISEASE 1030 1038\tepilepsy\nT19\tSIGN 1030 1038\tepilepsy\nT20\tSIGN 1116 1123;1135 1143\tseizure absences\nT21\tSIGN 1116 1123;1145 1154\tseizure myoclonic\nT22\tSIGN 1160 1175\tatonic seizures\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 1238 1263\tmyoclonic-atonic epilepsy\nT24\tDISEASE 1314 1334\tgeneralized epilepsy\nT25\tSIGN 1314 1334\tgeneralized epilepsy\nT26\tDISEASE 1348 1362\tfocal epilepsy\nT27\tSIGN 1348 1362\tfocal epilepsy\nT28\tSIGN 1443 1523\tirregular bursts of diffuse 2.5-3.5 Hz spikes/polyspikes-and-slow waves in 25/31\nT29\tDISEASE 1585 1603\tstatus epilepticus\nT30\tSIGN 1585 1616\tstatus epilepticus during sleep\nT31\tSIGN 1618 1624\tAtaxia\nT32\tRAREDISEASE 1665 1688\tEpiletic Encephalopathy\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T30\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T19\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T20\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T21\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T22\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T25\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T27\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T28\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T300\t\nR20\tProduces Arg1:T32 Arg2:T31\t\n'}, {'text': 'Diencephalic syndrome is a rare disorder caused by a tumor that is usually located in the diencephalon, a portion of the brain just above the brainstem.

However, recent outbreaks of mumps among adolescents and young adults have raised questions about lifetime immunity from the vaccine. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that is transmitted through saliva by direct contact, or in the form of airborne droplets from the nose, throat or mouth.  The virus enters the body through the upper respiratory tract. Since 1967 when an effective and safe vaccine was developed, mumps has become uncommon.   It affects males and females in equal numbers.  Among those not immunized, the disease strikes most often in children between the ages of five and fifteen, but adults can also be affected.

Symptoms usually begin to show in people around 50 years old, as cysts grow in size and number with age [1]. Some people begin to have symptoms in early adulthood and many affected individuals do not have symptoms. The growth and accumulation of cysts can cause enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and compression of adjacent anatomical structures, leading to abdominal pain and discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), indigestion (dyspepsia), gastro-esophageal reflux, and limited mobility [3-6]. More rarely, liver cysts can also compress the bile duct and lead to yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Compression of the blood vessels of the liver by cysts can lead to accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), bleeding, and high blood pressure in the blood flow from intestines to the liver (portal hypertension) [12-14].  In rare cases, patients can suffer from cyst bleeding (hepatic cyst hemorrhage), or a cyst can be infected by bacteria (hepatic cyst infection), causing pain and fever. Infrequently, large liver cysts may rupture, causing severe abdominal pain. (Van Aerts et al. 2017) Even with the presence of many cysts, the liver of individuals with polycystic liver disease functions normally. Polycystic liver disease affects around one in 100,000 people [1, 2]. Males and females are affected in equal numbers, but most patients with symptoms and with severe disease are women. The suggested cause of this difference is that female sex hormones, such as estrogen, contribute to growth of liver cysts  [1, 3, 7, 13, 17, 22]. Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy are also associated with more severe disease [23-25]. Cysts can begin to grow at any age, but are rare in childhood and more common with age. The age at which symptoms begin to occur varies with individuals, but is usually around 50 years old.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 22\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 33 55\tgenetic liver disorder\nT3\tANAPHOR 154 156\tIt\nT4\tSIGN 279 287\tjaundice\nT5\tSIGN 296 301;320 339\tliver enlarged and tender\nT6\tSIGN 341 349\tJaundice\nT7\tSIGN 370 386\texcess bilirubin\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 434 456\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nT9\tANAPHOR 504 516\tThe disorder\nT10\tSIGN 586 611\tenlarged and tender liver\nT11\tSYMPTOM 628 636\tweakness\nT12\tSYMPTOM 643 658\tpainful abdomen\nT13\tSIGN 746 754\tjaundice\nT14\tANAPHOR 806 817\tthe disease\nT15\tRAREDISEASE 884 906\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nT16\tDISEASE 989 1013\tclassic genetic diseases\nT17\tDISEASE 1122 1141\trecessive disorders\nT18\tDISEASE 1513 1531\trecessive disorder\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 1865 1887\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nT20\tANAPHOR 1956 1968\tThe disorder\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 2122 2144\tDubin-Johnson Syndrome\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 2300 2322\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nT23\tSIGN 2424 2447\trecurrent mild jaundice\nT24\tRAREDISEASE 2519 2541\tDubin-Johnson Syndrome\nT25\tRAREDISEASE 2758 2780\tDubin Johnson Syndrome\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T30\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T21\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T8 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tAnaphora Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T23\t\n'}, {'text': 'Warburg Micro syndrome is an extremely rare disorder.

rare congenital developmental disorder characterized by anomalies of the lower spine and the lower limbs. Affected infants are born with partial or complete fusion of the legs. Additional malformations may also occur including genitourinary abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, anomalies of the lumbarsacral spine and pelvis and absence or underdevelopment (agenesis) of one or both kidneys. Affected infants may have one foot, no feet or both feet, which may be rotated externally. The tailbone is usually absent and the sacrum is partially or completely absent as well. Additional conditions may occur with sirenomelia including imperforate anus, spina bifida, and heart (cardiac) malformations. Sirenomelia is often fatal during the newborn period. The exact cause of sirenomelia is unknown, most cases occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). Sirenomelia affects males more often than females by a ratio of 2.7-1. The exact incidence is unknown, but sirenomelia is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 60,000 to 100,000 births. Sirenomelia occurs with greater frequency in one twin of identical (monozygotic) twins than it does in fraternal (dizygotic) twins or individuals. A diagnosis of sirenomelia can be made prenatally, most often during the second trimester, by fetal ultrasound. An ultrasound is an exam that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the developing fetus. A fetal ultrasound can detect some of the defects associated with sirenomelia.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 138 161\tendomyocardial fibrosis\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 166 184\tLoeffler’s disease\nT3\tANAPHOR 212 227\tboth conditions\nT4\tANAPHOR 410 425\tthese disorders\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 491 514\tendomyocardial fibrosis\nT6\tDISEASE 537 553\thypersensitivity\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 600 623\tendomyocardial fibrosis\nT8\tDISEASE 653 658\tmumps\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 666 689\tEndomyocardial fibrosis\nT10\tANAPHOR 751 753\tIt\nT11\tANAPHOR 803 805\tIt\nT12\tANAPHOR 859 870\tThe disease\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 1056 1079\tendomyocardial fibrosis\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 1083 1101\tLoeffler’s disease\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T12\t\n'}, {'text': 'Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the Western world varies.

This group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures).\xa0The muscular contractions may be sustained or come and go (intermittent). Movements may be patterned and twisting, and/or in some cases shaking or quivering (tremulous) resembling a tremor. Dystonia may occur or be worsened when an individual attempts a voluntary action. There are many different causes for dystonia. Genetic as well as non-genetic factors can contribute to the development of these disorders. In some cases, the exact, underlying cause is unknown (idiopathic). The most characteristic finding associated with most forms of dystonia is twisting, repetitive movements that affect the neck, torso, limbs, eyes, face, vocal chords, and/or a combination of these muscle groups. Certain forms such as laryngeal dystonia are not associated with abnormal postures. Dystonia causes varying degrees of pain and disability that ranges from mild symptoms that come and go to severe, debilitating symptoms that can significantly affect a person’s quality of life. In some cases dystonia can become progressively worse, while in others it remains unchanged or no longer worsens (plateaus). Dystonia may even spontaneously remit in rare cases. Treatment for dystonia depends upon several factors including the specific subtype present and can include medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy and surgery. Dystonia can affect individuals of any age, gender, race, or ethnic background. It is estimated that as many as 300,000 people in North America may be affected by the various forms of dystonia. However, because many cases of dystonia go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of dystonia in the general population is difficult.

These parasites are liver flukes that live in plant-eating animals. Liver flukes can be found on water plants in certain parts of the world. When the parasite invades the liver, bile passages may be blocked. A subdivision of Fascioliasis called Halzoun Syndrome affects the throat (pharynx). This infection can usually be controlled and/or cured with timely treatment. The disease has three phases: acute, latent, and chronic.  The acute phase begins approximately four days after infection and can last for two to four months.  Symptoms during this phase include fever, abdominal pain with tender liver, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hives (urticaria) accompanied by bouts of bronchial asthma.  The latent phase begins when mature flukes reach the bile duct and can last for several months.  Individuals in this phase are asymptomatic.  The chronic phase can persist for several years.  Symptoms include gastrointestinal pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, itching, and abdominal tenderness. Fascioliasis is caused by infection with the parasitic worms of the genus Fasciola, of which “Fasciola hepatica”, found in temperate climates, and “Fasciola gigantica”, found in tropical climates, are the most common.  Encysted parasitic larvae of these parasites live on water plants, such as watercress, that may be eaten by man or eaten by animals that subsequently are eaten by man.  Once ingested, the larvae escape from the cysts in the small intestine and migrate across the intestinal wall into the abdominal cavity.  They transform into immature worms and, once they reach the liver, move around for up to six weeks, feeding on liver tissue.  Eventually, they take up residence in the bile ducts, where they cause lesions and chronic liver disease.  Generally, the parasite can be killed by adequate cooking of foods before they are eaten. Liver fluke disease should be suspected if the patient recently spent time in a region where infection is prevalent in animals and/or humans. Patients usually report eating wild watercress, algae, or other aquatic plants. Acute and chronic infection can be confirmed by testing that detects liver fluke-specific antibodies in body fluids. Also, parasite eggs may be detected in the stool at the chronic stage of infection.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 24\tChromosome 4, Trisomy 4p\nT2\tDISEASE 35 55\tchromosomal disorder\nT3\tSIGN 475 482;497 509\tfeeding difficulties\nT4\tSIGN 487 509\tbreathing difficulties\nT5\tSIGN 511 582\tcharacteristic malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area\nT6\tSIGN 588 614\tabnormalities of the hands\nT7\tSIGN 588 608;619 623\tabnormalities of the feet\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 750 760\tTrisomy 4p\nT9\tDISEASE 786 811\tsevere mental retardation\nT10\tSIGN 786 811\tsevere mental retardation\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 813 837\tChromosome 4, Trisomy 4p\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 904 945\tTrisomy for the short arm of chromosome 4\nT13\tANAPHOR 1089 1101\tthe syndrome\nT14\tDISEASE 1153 1174\tchromosomal disorders\nT15\tRAREDISEASE 1226 1250\tChromosome 4, Trisomy 4p\nT16\tDISEASE 1420 1440\tchromosomal disorder\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T40\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tIs_synon Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tIs_synon Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n'}, {'text': 'Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a hereditary disorder characterized by an inadequate response to the parathyroid hormone, although the hormone is present in normal amounts.

Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea), and the absence of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and ovulation (anovulatory) for more than 6 months after childbirth.  These symptoms occur even though the mother is not nursing the baby.  The pregnancy which precedes the onset of Chiari-Frommel Syndrome is usually normal, and childbirth and initial lactation are uneventful.  However, normal menstrual periods and ovulation do not resume, and persistent discharge from the nipples occurs, which can sometimes last for years.

TRPS1 is characterized by thin, sparse scalp hair, unusual facial features, abnormalities of the fingers and/or toes, and multiple abnormalities of the "growing ends" (epiphyses) of the bones (skeletal dysplasia), especially in the hands and feet. Characteristic facial features may include a rounded (bulbous) "pear-shaped" nose, an abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), dental anomalies, and/or unusually large (prominent) ears. In most cases, the fingers and/or toes may be abnormally short (brachydactyly) and curved. In addition, affected individuals may exhibit short stature. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. In most cases, Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I has autosomal dominant inheritance. Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I is an extremely rare inherited disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In those individuals with mild symptoms, a diagnosis may be easily missed or go unreported. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the true frequency of this disorder in the general population. Many researchers suspect there may be a higher incidence of TRPS1 than is actually reported in the medical literature. The diagnosis of TRPS1 may be suspected upon identification of characteristic physical features (e.g., rounded [bulbous] nose; thin, sparse hair; etc.). The diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and X-ray studies of the skeleton that reveal distinctive abnormalities of the hands and feet (e.g., epiphyseal coning).

The lack of the CPSI enzyme results in excessive accumulation of nitrogen, in the form of ammonia (hyperammonemia), in the blood.

Initial symptoms range from bloody nose, runny nose, double vision, and bulging eye to chronic infections and nasal obstruction. It has been associated with several types of papilloma in the nasal cavity, which are benign, but can give rise to malignancy. Prior irradiation for other cancers has been associated with the development of SNUC in a number of cases, and has been associated with a genetic mutation known to be associated with cancer development. Most patients have not had prior irradiation, and no other causes have demonstrated to be significant, though some studies have found that woodworkers and nickel factory workers are generally more susceptible to sinonasal malignancy of all types. Symptoms include bloody nose (epistaxis), runny nose (rhinorrhea), bulging eye (exopthalmos/proptosis), double vision (diplopia), nasal obstruction, and nasal infection.

The main signs and symptoms are related to the encephalopathy. The onset of impaired brain function is rapid (acute), while other times it can develop slowly over many years. The specific symptoms, severity, and course of the disorder can vary greatly among affected individuals. The disorder often responds to therapy with corticosteroids.

It is a symptom of another disease or condition, or a side effect of diuretic drugs. The body needs potassium for the contraction of muscles (including the heart), and for the functioning of many complicated proteins (enzymes). Potassium is found primarily in the skeletal muscle and bone, and participates with sodium to contribute to the normal flow of body fluids between the cells in the body. The normal concentration of potassium in the body is regulated by the kidneys through the excretion of urine. When the kidneys are functioning normally, the amount of potassium in the diet is sufficient for use by the body and the excess is usually excreted through urine and sweat. Body chemicals and hormones such as aldosterone also regulate potassium balance. Secretion of the hormone insulin, which is normally stimulated by food, prevents a temporary diet-induced Hypokalemia by increasing cell absorption of potassium. When Hypokalemia occurs, there is an imbalance resulting from a dysfunction in this normal process, or the rapid loss of urine or sweat without replacement of sufficient potassium. Hypokalemia may affect both males and females.  However, it occurs more commonly in females. The underlying cause of Hypokalemia must first be treated. When the hypokalemia is severe, potassium chloride may be administered orally or intravenously. Treatment must be carefully monitored by a physician. Any associated acid-base disorders or hormonal disturbances must be evaluated before treatment is planned. The administration of potassium and potassium- sparing diuretics is usually discouraged in patients with kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system. The imbalance of external and internal potassium levels in these individuals may predispose them to life-threatening degrees of Hyperkalemia (too much potassium). Hypokalemia in individuals with high blood pressure taking diuretics may be improved by replacing lost potassium in the diet through certain fruits or potassium drugs. Hypokalemia may also be minimized by dietary restriction of salt since high rates of sodium excretion promote urinary potassium losses. People who participate in vigorous sports or exercise in warm weather should be sure to replace potassium that is lost through excessive sweating. This can be accomplished through dietary planning.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 158 173\tTietze syndrome\nT2\tANAPHOR 205 217\tthe disorder\nT3\tDISEASE 307 312;326 336\tviral infections\nT4\tDISEASE 316 336\tbacterial infections\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 371 386\tTietze syndrome\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 544 559\tTietze syndrome\nT7\tANAPHOR 701 713\tthe disorder\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 741 756\tTietze syndrome\nT9\tSYMPTOM 912 922\tchest pain\nT10\tSYMPTOM 1045 1055\tchest pain\nT11\tDISEASE 1066 1090\tcardiovascular disorders\nT12\tDISEASE 1094 1114\tmalignant conditions\nT13\tSIGN 1159 1206\thickening and enlargement of affected cartilage\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T130\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\n'}, {'text': 'Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, making up about 80% of people with acute leukemia.

This enzyme is necessary to break down (metabolize) glycogen, a carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscle and used for energy. Deficiency of this enzyme results in the abnormal accumulation of glycogen in the body. Hers disease is one of a group of disorders known as the glycogen storage disorders. It is characterized by enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), moderately low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), elevated levels of acetone and other ketone bodies in the blood (ketosis), and moderate growth retardation. Symptoms are not always evident during childhood, and children are usually able to lead normal lives. The incidence of glycogen storage diseases is estimated to be between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 25,000 persons in the United States. The incidence of Hers disease is unknown, although the disorder has a higher prevalence in the Mennonite population. Symptoms of Hers disease are usually not noticed until adulthood although the disorder may present in childhood. A diagnosis of Hers disease is based on a test for activity of the liver phosphorylase enzyme. A small fragment of liver tissue is surgically removed (biopsy) and assayed for the activity of the enzyme. In persons with Hers disease, this enzyme activity will be reduced.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 30\tProgressive myoclonus epilepsy\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 32 35\tPME\nT3\tANAPHOR 154 168\tThese diseases\nT4\tSIGN 283 292\tmyoclonus\nT5\tDISEASE 308 316\tepilepsy\nT6\tSIGN 308 316\tepilepsy\nT7\tSIGN 359 366\tseizure\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 400 403\tPME\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 507 537\tProgressive myoclonus epilepsy\nT10\tRAREDISEASE 748 751\tPME\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T60\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\n'}, {'text': '"WAGR syndrome/11p deletion syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome in which there is a predisposition to several conditions, including certain malignancies, distinctive eye abnormalities, and/or intellectual disability.

Symptoms associated with Budd Chiari syndrome include pain in the upper right part of the abdomen, an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly), and/or accumulation of fluid in the space (peritoneal cavity) between the two layers of the membrane that lines the stomach (ascites). Additional findings that may be associated with the disorder include nausea, vomiting, and/or an abnormally large spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of the disorder varies from case to case, depending upon the site and number of affected veins. In some cases, if the major hepatic veins are involved, high blood pressure in the veins carrying blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract back to the heart through the liver (portal hypertension) may be present. In most cases, the exact cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome is unknown. Budd-Chiari syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Most cases tend to affect individuals between the ages of twenty and forty. A diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. A procedure in which a radiographic dye is administered into the body to allow for x-rays of the blood vessels (angiography) is often used to aid diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) and ultrasound are also used as diagnostic procedures.

These conditions are characterized by progressive balance problems (disequilibrium), progressive impairment of the ability to coordinate voluntary movements (cerebellar ataxia), and difficulty speaking or slurred speech (dysarthria). OPCA is a group of rare disorders that affects males and females in equal numbers. Because of confusion regarding the naming and classification of these disorders, determining their frequency in the general population is difficult. The frequency of all forms of OPCA has been estimated to be 3-5/100,000 in the United States. A diagnosis of OPCA is a preliminary diagnosis that is made by a thorough clinical examination and identification of characteristic symptoms. Hereditary OPCA can be diagnosed based on a family history of the same condition or by molecular genetic testing for gene mutations known to be associated with the condition. Molecular genetic testing is available for several of the SCAs. A diagnosis of sporadic OPCA is made if hereditary OPCAs and other conditions associated with symptoms of OPCA are ruled out. Testing may include blood work to rule out other conditions, MRI scans of the brain to look for degenerative changes in the brainstem, EMG testing to look at the electrical testing of muscles and nerves and sometimes examination of spinal fluid.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 1 17\tFilippi syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 39 55\tgenetic disorder\nT3\tANAPHOR 100 112\tThe disorder\nT4\tSIGN 136 161\tunusual facial appearance\nT5\tSIGN 163 200\tabnormalities of the fingers and toes\nT6\tSIGN 206 239\tmild to severe mental retardation\nT7\tDISEASE 221 239\tmental retardation\nT8\tSIGN 275 288\tgrowth delays\nT9\tSIGN 309 319\tsyndactyly\nT10\tSIGN 379 391\tclinodactyly\nT11\tDISEASE 432 444\tmicrocephaly\nT12\tSIGN 432 444\tmicrocephaly\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 562 578\tFilippi syndrome\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 644 660\tFilippi syndrome\nT15\tANAPHOR 948 961\tthe disorder.\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T12\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T50\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tAnaphora Arg1:T20 Arg2:T22\t\n'}, {'text': 'WRS is an extremely rare genetic disorder that appears to affect males and females relatively equally.

The rash is usually located on the back, chest and stomach and resolves on its own within one to three months. Certain treatments may reduce the duration of the rash. Researchers believe that pityriasis rosea is caused by an infectious pathogen, but they have been unable to isolate and identify such a pathogen.

Normally, the human heart has four chambers of which two are the atria. These two are separated from each other by a partition (septum) called the atrial septum. The other two chambers, known as ventricles, are also separated by a septum. In cor triatriatum there is a small extra chamber above the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins, returning blood from the lungs, drain into this extra ""third atrium."" The passage of blood from the lungs into the heart (left atrium and ventricle) is slowed by this extra chamber. Cor triatriatum may eventually lead to features of congestive heart failure and obstruction over time. The exact cause of cor triatriatum is not known. Cor triatriatum is an extremely rare congenital heart condition that affects males and females in equal numbers.  In the USA, this disorder accounts for an extremely small percentage (0.1% to 0.4%) of all infants with congenital heart disease. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum is usually made by using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (EC). In another procedure known as a cardiac catheterization, a long fine tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and then channeled directly into the heart.

One of the consequences of polyarteritis is the reduction of blood flow to any of several organs and/or arms and legs. Arteries in the head and arms may be affected, and this can result in the loss of the major pulse points in the body. Some people with Takayasu arteritis have irregular narrowing of portions of the large arteries (segmental stenosis) and abnormal backward flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle of the heart (aortic regurgitation). Other patients may have symptoms of ballooning and weakening (aneurysm) of the wall of a major vessel. Takayasu arteritis is a rare disorder that affects more females than males.

Some males with 47, XXY (KS) are mosaic, meaning that some cells have an extra X chromosome and other cells do not. Mosaic 47, XXY (KS) occurs because of an error in the division of the sex chromosomes in the zygote after fertilization. The extra X chromosome typically results in primary testicular failure leading to androgen deficiency. 47, XXY (KS) is the most common human sex chromosome disorder and occurs in approximately 1 in 500-1,000 males. It is estimated that 3,000 affected boys are born each year in the United States. Kallmann syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that mostly, but not exclusively, affects men. The major characteristics of Kallmann syndrome, in both men and women, are the failure to experience puberty and the complete or partial loss of the sense of smell. Failure to go through puberty reflects a hormonal imbalance that is caused by a failure of a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. Patients with Kallmann syndrome show evidence of small genitalia, sterile gonads that cannot produce the sex cells (hypogonadism), and a loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). The impaired production of hormones as well as sperm and egg cells causes delayed puberty, growth and infertility. (For more information on this disorder, choose “Kallmann syndrome” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Males with 47, XXY (KS) are most commonly identified before birth (e.g. through prenatal screenings for chromosomal disorders), at puberty, or later in life because of infertility. 47, XXY (KS) is diagnosed by a chromosome karyotype analysis on a blood sample or by a chromosomal microarray (CMA) test. CMA consists of an oral cheek (buccal) swab and is an easy and painless way to detect abnormalities of chromosome numbers and provide a definitive diagnosis. 47, XXY (KS) can also be diagnosed prenatally on chorionic villous or amniotic fluid cells.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 57\tAcute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 59 65\tAPMPPE\nT3\tDISEASE 77 89\teye disorder\nT4\tANAPHOR 121 133\tThe disorder\nT5\tSIGN 158 197\timpairment of central vision in one eye\nT6\tANAPHOR 303 315\tthe disorder\nT7\tANAPHOR 446 459\tThis disorder\nT8\tDISEASE 601 610\tinfluenza\nT9\tANAPHOR 652 664\tthe disorder\nT10\tRAREDISEASE 685 742\tacute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy\nT11\tANAPHOR 783 785\tit\nT12\tANAPHOR 812 814\tIt\nT13\tANAPHOR 848 850\tit\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 1010 1067\tAcute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy\nT15\tDISEASE 1078 1093\tvisual disorder\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 1156 1213\tacute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T60\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR8\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tIs_a Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\n'}, {'text': 'Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is an extremely rare disease characterized by various intestinal polyps, loss of taste, hair loss, and nail growth problems.

Other skeletal malformations of the cervical spine and ribs and the abnormal development of bone at multiple soft tissue sites may lead episodically to stiffness in affected areas, limited movement, and eventual ankylosis of affected joints (neck, shoulders, elbows, hips knees, wrists, ankles, jaw, often in that order).\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 35\tPrimary intestinal lymphangiectasia\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 37 40\tPIL\nT3\tDISEASE 52 70\tdigestive disorder\nT4\tSIGN 109 118;120 177\tdilatated lymph vessels supplying the lining of the small intestine\nT5\tSIGN 211 216\tedema\nT6\tSYMPTOM 235 255\tabdominal discomfort\nT7\tANAPHOR 257 269\tThe disorder\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 372 375\tPIL\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 448 451\tPIL\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T70\t\nR6\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\n'}, {'text': 'Weaver Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males three times more often than females.

Attacks often last several days and require emergency care. They are sometimes fatal. SCLS occurs most often in adults and the disease is very rare in children. SCLS is not hereditary. More than one half of patients have a monoclonal or M protein detected in the blood. The level of M protein is usually low.  The M protein is produced by what usually amount to small numbers of plasma cells in the marrow.   The M protein itself does not appear to cause the attacks. Many possible explanations have been offered including an autoimmune mechanism. Recently it has been suggested that capillary lining cells may be damaged by a factor in the blood, which is produced during the acute attack.  SCLS has been recognized in a range of racial backgrounds and nationalities. Although the cause of SCLS is not yet known, there appears to be no genetic predisposition to the disease. There are less than 100 patients reported in the world literature since its first description in 1960 by Clarkson. SCLS seems to occur more often in males and older adults. The disease may be more frequent than the literature suggests because the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. SCLS may be mistaken for a severe infection such as septic shock or toxic shock syndrome.  Some features such as the swelling may lead one to suspect heart failure or kidney disease. C-1 esterase inhibitor deficiency syndrome may present with a type of recurring edema called angioedema and is often thought of in patients presenting with SCLS.

Early in the disease process, neonates can exhibit signs of feeding intolerance with vomiting, increased gastric aspirates, bile-tinged (green) gastric aspirates, or decreased bowel sounds with abdominal distention and tenderness. Gross or occult blood can be present in stools indicating mucosal injury. Many of these signs are non-specific and can occur with other disorders. Progression of NEC results in systemic signs such as lethargy, long pauses in breathing called apnea, temperature instability, and poor perfusion (pumping of fluid through an organ or tissue.) Ultimately this can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. A palpable mass and erythema (abnormal redness of the skin due to capillary congestion, as in inflammation) of the abdominal wall is indicative of a more advanced disease process. NEC affects 5 to 10% of premature infants born weighing less than 1500 g. Among the risk factors defined for NEC, prematurity and birth weight remain inversely related to risk for NEC. Term infants who develop NEC usually have specific risk factors such as congenital heart disease, sepsis, and low blood pressure. Many other gastrointestinal diseases can mimic NEC, so when evaluating a patient it is important to consider and treat alternative etiologies. Sepsis can cause an ileus with abdominal distention and feeding intolerance. Premature infants, especially those on indomethacin or steroids can also present with spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). SIP is characterized by isolated perforation of the distal small bowel. Other causes of severe abdominal distention in neonates include bowel obstruction from Hirshsprung’s disease, small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, and malrotation with volvulus. NEC can also be mistaken for allergic enterocolitis secondary to cow’s milk protein allergy. NEC is diagnosed clinically and radiographically. Once clinical suspicion arises, an abdominal X-ray is performed as an initial evaluation. This is repeated serially depending on acuity and clinical course to assess disease progression. Characteristic findings on NEC process on abdominal radiographs include pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), abnormal persistent dilated loops, thickened bowel wall, pneumoperitoneum and portal vein gas. Pneumoperitoneum defined as abdominal free air is a surgical emergency indicating bowel perforation and usually requires intervention. Abdominal ultrasonography can also be used to evaluate for free fluid in the abdominal cavity or abscess formation. Addition laboratory studies to evaluate severity of NEC include a blood culture, coagulation studies and complete blood count with manual differential to assess for leukocytosis with bandemia, neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Blood gases are checked serially to assess severity of acidosis and need for respiratory support or to assist with fluid management.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 16\tGottron syndrome\nT2\tSKINRAREDISEASE 18 20\tGS\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 114 122\tprogeria\nT4\tSIGN 114 122\tprogeria\nT5\tSIGN 161 222\tfragile, thin skin on the hands and feet (distal extremities)\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 225 227\tGS\nT7\tDISEASE 246 278;287 299\tmild, nonprogressive, congenital skin atrophy\nT8\tSIGN 361 381\tsubcutaneous atrophy\nT9\tSIGN 422 433\tsmall hands\nT10\tSIGN 422 427;438 442\tsmall feet\nT11\tSIGN 458 486\tprominent veins on the chest\nT12\tSIGN 488 501\tsmall stature\nT13\tSIGN 532 544\tmicrognathia\nT14\tSKINRAREDISEASE 578 594\tGottron syndrome\nT15\tSIGN 636 640;654 706\tskin thin, taut, and parchment-like on the hands and feet\nT16\tSIGN 734 739;767 772\thands small\nT17\tSIGN 744 748;767 772\tfeet small\nT18\tSIGN 794 843\tveins on the chest are very visible and prominent\nT19\tSIGN 851 861;893 909\tdiminished subcutaneous fat\nT20\tSKINRAREDISEASE 932 948\tGottron syndrome\nT21\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1072 1088\tGottron syndrome\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T40\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tIs_a Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T130\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T19\t\n'}, {'text': 'Fragile X syndrome is characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild intellectual disability in affected females.

Reported instances of imperforate anus include affected individuals in whom the condition appeared to occur sporadically, members of certain multigenerational families (kindreds), and individuals in whom the condition occurred in association with other birth defects or malformation syndromes (e.g., VACTERL association). Imperforate anus is surgically corrected by dilating, enlarging or repositioning the external opening, or other ways of providing an adequate rectal opening.

Mucolipidosis IV is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait and caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene. Mucolipidosis IV is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder was first identified in 1974 and as of 2010, 70 cases have been reported in the medical literature.  The precise incidence is unknown, but is estimated to be approximately 1:40,000. About 70% of those diagnosed are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Mucolipidosis IV may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical examination, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. Individuals with mucolipidosis IV present with iron deficiency anemia, high serum gastrin levels and characteristic findings on brain MRI examinations. In most cases, an electron microscope is used to visualize characteristic lysosomal storage bodies in fibroblasts obtained from biopsied tissue of the skin and/or the delicate membrane that lines the eyes (conjunctiva).

Major symptoms include an underdeveloped (hypoplasia) upper jaw, downward-slanting palpebral fissures (which means that the opening between the eyelids slants downward), minor malformations of the external portion of the ears, and speech abnormalities. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A second (distinct) form of maxillofacial dysostosis is believed to be inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Maxillofacial dysostosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Genetic diseases are determined by the combination of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes received from the father and the mother. Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual. The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. Maxillofacial dysostosis is extremely rare and the exact incidence of the disorder is unknown. Approximately 12 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Researchers believe that cases of maxillofacial dysostosis may go misdiagnosed or unrecognized making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population. Maxillofacial dysostosis most likely affects males and females in equal numbers. A diagnosis of maxillofacial dysostosis is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests to rule out other disorders.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 29\tExtrinsic allergic alveolitis\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 0 29;152 162\tExtrinsic allergic alveolitis acute form\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 0 29;247 259\tExtrinsic allergic alveolitis chronic form\nT4\tDISEASE 35 48\tlung disorder\nT5\tSYMPTOM 165 184\tespiratory symptoms\nT6\tSIGN 189 194\tfever\nT7\tSIGN 280 314\tgradual changes in the lung tissue\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 411 440\tExtrinsic Allergic Alveolitis\nT9\tSIGN 449 469\tbreathing difficulty\nT10\tSIGN 471 479\twheezing\nT11\tSIGN 485 495\tdry coughs\nT12\tSIGN 535 541\tChills\nT13\tSIGN 543 551\tsweating\nT14\tSIGN 553 559\taching\nT15\tSIGN 561 571\tdiscomfort\nT16\tSIGN 579 586\tfatigue\nT17\tSIGN 601 614\tlung symptoms\nT18\tANAPHOR 631 644\tthis disorder\nT19\tSIGN 862 867\tfever\nT20\tSIGN 904 909\trales\nT21\tSIGN 912 932\tbreathing difficulty\nT22\tSIGN 965 973\tcyanosis\nT23\tSIGN 990 1012\texpectoration of blood\nT24\tRAREDISEASE 1016 1045\tExtrinsic allergic alveolitis\nT25\tRAREDISEASE 1262 1291\textrinsic allergic alveolitis\nT26\tDISEASE 1348 1365\tallergic reaction\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tIs_a Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T170\t\nR14\tAnaphora Arg1:T8 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T19\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T20\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T210\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T22\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T23\t\n'}, {'text': 'Q fever is an infectious disease that is spread by the inhalation or ingestion of a bacterium known as Coxiella burnetii, which belongs to the order of Legionellales.

MRI is the imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation of brain tumors. Although the presence of a meningioma can be suspected with medical imaging due to their characteristic location, analysis of the cells of the tumor provides the most definitive diagnosis. Meningioma cells can be obtained by removing a piece of the tumor with a biopsy. However, meningiomas are usually removed surgically without a prior biopsy as this provides therapeutic in addition to diagnostic benefit. Once tumor cells are obtained, they can be observed under the microscope by a pathologist, who will confirm the diagnosis.

This disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or may occur as the result of another underlying disorder (acquired). Muscles control the movements of the eyes. Some of these muscles turn the eyeball up and down, move the eyeball from side to side, or enable the eyeball to rotate slightly in its socket. The superior oblique tendon sheath of the superior oblique muscle surrounds the eyeball. The symptoms of Brown Syndrome are caused by abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. This results in the inability to move the affected eye upward. People with Brown Syndrome have limited eye movement in the affected eye. The ability to move the eyeball toward the center (adduction), or outward from the center (abduction), may be restricted or absent.  One eye may appear to be out of alignment with the unaffected eye, especially when looking upward.  The symptoms of Brown Syndrome may also include a droopy eyelid (ptosis), widening of the eye (palpebral fissure) when looking upward, crossing of the eyes (strabismus), and/or a backward head tilt.  A downward appearance (hypotropia) is usually present in the affected eye when the individual is looking straight ahead (primary position) or in an upward direction.  One eye is usually affected, but both eyes (bilateral) may be affected in approximately 10 percent of people with Brown Syndrome.

It is characterized by the development of progressive weakness in muscles that were affected by the original polio infection. In addition, those affected may experience extreme fatigue and joint pain. Skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, may occur as a result of this syndrome. There is variation in the severity of symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms may mimic those of the rare disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The degree of muscle atrophy during the post-polio period appears to reflect the severity of the impact of the initial polio infection. People who were significantly affected by polio are more likely to experience severe symptoms from post-polio syndrome. The cause of this syndrome is not known. Although exact numbers are not available, it has been estimated that there are 300,000 polio survivors in the United States and that from one-fourth to one-half of them may ultimately develop some degree of post-polio syndrome. Post-polio syndrome affects people who have had acute episodes of poliomyelitis.  It occurs 10 years or more after the original illness, and can occur as long as 40 years afterward.  According to one estimate, 25% to 50% of the 300,000 polio survivors in the United States may develop the syndrome.  At the present time, there is no known way to prevent the syndrome. Diagnosis of post-polio syndrome is made on the basis of a thorough history, a neurological examination, and the process of excluding other possible diseases through various tests.

The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Eosinophils are an important part of the immune system and play a role in immune regulation and fighting certain infection, and their accumulation is a hallmark of allergic diseases. This condition is characterized by vomiting, stomach or chest pain, failure to thrive (particularly in children), difficulty swallowing, and food getting stuck in the throat. The symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis are variable, especially in people of different ages. Common symptoms include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); food getting stuck in the throat (impaction); nausea; vomiting; poor growth; weight loss; stomach pain; poor appetite; and malnutrition. Because of an overlap of these symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), many patients are initially thought to have GERD, but EoE patients do not typically respond to anti-GERD therapy and can be found not to have GERD upon diagnostic workup. Recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, typically used for the treatment of GERD, but these patients with PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) do not typically have GERD but rather a disease variant similar to EoE; the PPI appears to exert its effects by direct action rather than blockade of stomach acid alone. Individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis often have allergic diseases such as asthma or eczema. The frequency of eosinophilic esophagitis has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 1,000 children. This condition has been reported in multiple continents including Europe, Australia, and America.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 19\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT2\tDISEASE 30 43\tskin disorder\nT3\tANAPHOR 74 86\tThe disorder\nT4\tSIGN 107 122\tintense itching\nT5\tSKINRAREDISEASE 198 217\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT6\tSIGN 218 267\tabnormalities affecting the apocrine sweat glands\nT7\tSIGN 275 287;305 318\tinflammation of the glands\nT8\tSIGN 293 318\tenlargement of the glands\nT9\tSIGN 342 357\tintense itching\nT10\tSIGN 359 363;397 405\tSkin darkened\nT11\tSIGN 359 363;410 413\tSkin dry\nT12\tSIGN 449 456\tpapules\nT13\tSIGN 552 561\thair loss\nT14\tSKINRAREDISEASE 582 601\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT15\tSKINRAREDISEASE 614 633\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT16\tANAPHOR 716 718\tit\nT17\tSKINRAREDISEASE 862 881\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT18\tSKINRAREDISEASE 984 1003\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT19\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1108 1127\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT20\tSKINRAREDISEASE 1198 1217\tFox-Fordyce disease\nT21\tSIGN 1286 1327\tpapular eruptions on apocrine gland areas\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T110\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tAnaphora Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T20 Arg2:T21\t\n'}, {'text': 'Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of red, scaly thickened patches of skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis), frequent pus-producing (pyogenic) skin infections, overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the fingernails and toenails (onychogryposis), and degeneration of the structures that surround and support the teeth (periodontosis).

LP most commonly presents as itchy, shiny, reddish-purple spots (lesions) on the skin (cutaneous LP) or as white-gray lesions in the mouth or on the lips (oral LP). Less commonly, LP may also involve the genitals (penile or vulvar LP), scalp (lichen planopilaris), ears (otic LP), nails, eyes, and esophagus. Similar to lichen found growing on trees and rocks in forests, the skin lesions are often flat-topped and can be somewhat scaly, hence the name “lichen” planus. In most affected individuals, the exact cause of LP is unclear. It is suspected that exposure to infections, drugs, allergens, or injury may sensitize the immune system and cause the immune system to attack skin cells. This initial eruption may persist for weeks to months, and recurrences can continue throughout the individual’s lifetime. There have been reports of LP in family members, indicating that there may be a genetic predisposition, but the genetic factors of LP are still being researched and are uncertain. There is limited data on how many people are affected by LP, but most studies estimate that LP occurs in less than 1 percent of the world’s population. Cutaneous LP occurs at similar frequencies in men and women, but women are somewhat more likely to develop oral LP or lichen planopilaris. There does not appear to be a racial predisposition for the disease. The majority of LP develops between 30 and 60 years of age but can affect older and younger individuals as well.

The birth prevalence of CCHS has been extrapolated from incidence figures and general birth rates, but the true prevalence is unknown as culturally diverse large population based studies have not been reported. Because the milder cases of CCHS may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to estimate the true frequency of CCHS in the general population, though the anticipation is far greater than the current estimate.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 20\tBudd-Chiari syndrome\nT2\tSIGN 122 135;84 93;95 101\thepatic veins occlusion of the\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 163 183\tBudd Chiari syndrome\nT4\tSYMPTOM 192 235\tpain in the upper right part of the abdomen\nT5\tSIGN 264 276\thepatomegaly\nT6\tSIGN 404 411\tascites\nT7\tANAPHOR 462 474\tthe disorder\nT8\tSYMPTOM 483 489\tnausea\nT9\tSIGN 491 499\tvomiting\nT10\tSIGN 536 548\tsplenomegaly\nT11\tANAPHOR 567 579\tthe disorder\nT12\tDISEASE 838 857\tportal hypertension\nT13\tSIGN 838 857\tportal hypertension\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 909 929\tBudd-Chiari syndrome\nT15\tRAREDISEASE 942 962\tBudd-Chiari syndrome\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 1098 1118\tBudd-Chiari syndrome\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 1706 1726\tBudd-Chiari syndrome\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T3 Arg2:T110\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\n'}, {'text': 'Schinzel Giedion syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.

Molecular genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis and guide genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is available through ultrasonography as early as 14 weeks, which can detect certain abnormalities (e.g., encephalocele, polydactyly, cystic kidneys and oligohydramnios).

The symptoms of the disorder can vary widely from person to another, even among members of the same family. Common symptoms include an uncoordinated or clumsy manner of walking (abnormal gait) and dystonia. Dystonia is a general term for a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Dystonia in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency usually affects the legs. Additional symptoms that may occur include tremors, eye abnormalities, and a tendency of affected children to walk on their tiptoes. The severe form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency causes symptoms at a very young age (first months of life). The symptoms generally do not resemble those of a movement disorder, but rather give the impression of a severe, diffuse brain disorder. Mild and moderate forms of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency show dramatic improvement when treated with levodopa. Levodopa is an amino acid that is converted to dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that serves as a neurotransmitter and is deficient in children with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment options for severe tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency have been less effective. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency occurs due to disruptions or changes (mutations) of the TH gene. The TH gene mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The exact incidence of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency in the general population is unknown. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature.

Some infected people may have no symptoms or only mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort but others may experience more severe symptoms reminiscent of an acute inflammation of the intestines. Symptoms of Balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. Most people with Balantidiasis are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms.  Some individuals may become acutely ill with abnormally high temperatures, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.  Such conditions may result in the excessive loss of water from the body (dehydration) and extreme exhaustion (prostration), especially if B. coli attacks the intestinal lining causing inflammation and possibly “crater-like” areas of damage (ulceration).  In very severe cases, the ulcers may be deep enough to puncture the intestinal wall (perforation) resulting in acute inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdomen (peritonitis). Occasionally, the ulcer may diminish lung function. Balantidiasis is a rare infectious disease caused by the single celled (protozoan) parasite Balantidium coli.  This parasite may be passed directly to humans by contact with pig feces or indirectly by drinking contaminated water.  Poor nutrition, a compromised immune system, or other illnesses may make a person vulnerable to more severe symptoms of this disease. Balantidiasis is a rare infection that affects males and females in equal numbers.

Often many family members are affected. (2) Chronic kidney disease develops. This initially is noticed as an elevated blood creatinine level. There are no symptoms from an elevated creatinine until it is very high, so often the elevated creatinine is found out on blood testing at a doctor’s office or in the hospital. Often, doctors are uncertain why the creatinine is elevated.  As chronic kidney disease progresses, and the creatinine rises more, patients develop symptoms of fatigue, anemia, and feel cold all the time. Decreased appetite and fluid retention develop as the patient nears the need for dialysis. (3) Dialysis or kidney transplant is required sometime between the 4th and 7th decade of life. (4) Several types of the disease are associated with elevated uric acid concentrations in blood and gout, which sometimes starts in the teenage years. In ADTKD-UMOD and ADTKD- REN, some – but not all - family members are affected by gout.

Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) is a common condition in which one or both of the flaps (cusps) of the mitral valve bulge or collapse backward (prolapse) into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole). In some cases, this may allow leakage or the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium (mitral regurgitation). Although mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) has been reported in individuals of various ages, it is most commonly noted in young adults.  Estimates indicate that MVP affects approximately four to eight percent of young adults in the general population, with females affected more commonly than males. As noted above, mitral valve prolapse syndrome may occur as an isolated condition or in association with various underlying disorders or syndromes.  For further information, please see the “Causes” section above or use the disease name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) may be diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination, a complete patient and family history, and various tests. The condition is often recognized through use of a stethoscope during routine physical examination, based upon detection of a characteristic clicking sound or sounds (systolic clicks) and/or a subsequent, delayed, high-pitched murmur (late systolic regurgitation murmur). The diagnosis may be confirmed based upon specialized imaging techniques, particularly echocardiography, during which sound waves are directed toward the heart, enabling physicians to identify abnormal positioning and prolapse of the mitral valve flaps. In some cases, additional cardiac and other diagnostic studies may be recommended to help confirm and assess the severity of potentially associated abnormalities, such as accompanying regurgitation.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 21\tWolff-Parkinson-White\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 23 26\tWPW\nT3\tDISEASE 47 72\tcongenital heart disorder\nT4\tSIGN 83 135\tirregularities in the electrical system of the heart\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 157 169\tWPW syndrome\nT6\tSIGN 174 211\tabnormal alternate electrical pathway\nT7\tSIGN 319 330\tarrhythmias\nT8\tSIGN 367 378\ttachycardia\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 381 393\tWPW syndrome\nT10\tRAREDISEASE 617 629\tWPW syndrome\nT11\tANAPHOR 671 683\tThe disorder\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\n'}, {'text': 'Metatropic Dysplasia I is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extremely small stature, with short arms and legs.

Gallstones develop when the components of bile, such as cholesterol and bilirubin, remain in the gallbladder and solidify into “pebble-like” material. Gallstones may lodge in the bile ducts and block the release of bile causing a backup. Up to 80% of all gallstones do not cause symptoms but obstruction within the bile ducts can cause gallbladder swelling (distension) and severe pain and tenderness of right side of abdomen and/or back (biliary colic). If the obstruction persists, it results in inflammation, infection, and even lack of blood flow (ischemia), a common condition known as acute cholecystitis, or acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC).  Repeated mild episodes of acute cholecystitis may result in chronic cholecystitis, causing thickening and shrinking of the gallbladder wall resulting in an inability to store bile.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 29\tEosinophilia-myalgia syndrome\nT2\tANAPHOR 122 134\tthe disorder\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 159 188\teosinophilia-myalgia syndrome\nT4\tANAPHOR 273 285\tthe disorder\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 382 411\teosinophilia-myalgia syndrome\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\n'}, {'text': 'Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that is detectable before birth (prenatally) and which follows a progressively degenerative path involving several organs of the body but especially the brain. It is characterized by seizures, mental retardation, stunted growth, failure to thrive, unstable body temperature, and very unusual color and texture of hair. Menkes disease is characterized by brittle, tangled, sparse, steely or kinky hair that is often white, ivory, or gray in color.  Unusual facial features include pudgy cheeks and abnormal eyebrows.  Affected infants are often born prematurely. Lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia) and excess bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) may occur causing a yellow appearance (jaundice). Hypothermia may also occur in older infants.  In some cases, early symptoms may resolve, and normal or slightly slowed development may proceed for two to three months.  Severe developmental delay, loss of early development skills, and convulsions may occur.  Brain abnormalities such as a blood clot at the base of the brain (subdural hematoma) and/or rupture or thrombosis of arteries in the brain not infrequently occur. Spastic dementia and seizures may eventually arise.  Weakened bones (osteoporosis) are common and can result in fractures. The combination of subdural hematoma and bone fractures may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of child abuse.  Emphysema, bladder abnormalities, degeneration of the retina and cysts of the iris have also been described. In rare cases, symptoms are very mild and only a few typical symptoms may appear. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of Menkes disease ranges from about 1 in 100,000 live births to 1 in 250,000 live births. Menkes disease is diagnosed by measurement of a decreased amount of copper and ceruloplasmin in blood plasma but these tests are not always reliable in the newborn period.  A new method of diagnosis that can potentially identify affected infants before copper deficiency affects the brain involves measurement of catecholamine levels in blood plasma.   Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the APT7A gene is available to confirm the diagnosis. Carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available if a specific ATP7A mutation in an affected family member.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 24\tSchwartz-Jampel syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 26 29\tSJS\nT3\tDISEASE 41 57\tgenetic disorder\nT4\tSIGN 75 112\tabnormalities of the skeletal muscles\nT5\tSIGN 155 172\tmyotonic myopathy\nT6\tDISEASE 164 172\tmyopathy\nT7\tSIGN 202 216\tbone dysplasia\nT8\tSIGN 289 307\tjoint contractures\nT9\tSIGN 317 330\tgrowth delays\nT10\tSIGN 370 378\tdwarfism\nT11\tSIGN 416 444\tsmall, fixed facial features\nT12\tSIGN 457 482\tabnormalities of the eyes\nT13\tSIGN 508 523\timpaired vision\nT14\tANAPHOR 605 617\tthe disorder\nT15\tRAREDISEASE 701 711\tSJS type 1\nT16\tANAPHOR 755 767\tthe disorder\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 832 842\tSJS type 2\nT18\tANAPHOR 864 876\tthe disorder\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 959 969\tSJS type 2\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 1003 1027\tStuve-Wiedemann syndrome\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 1046 1049\tSJS\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 1076 1100\tStuve-Wiedemann syndrome\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 1152 1155\tSJS\nT24\tRAREDISEASE 1157 1160\tSJS\nT25\tRAREDISEASE 1435 1445\tSJS type 2\nT26\tANAPHOR 1547 1559\tthe disorder\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T130\t\nR11\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR13\tIs_a Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tIs_a Arg1:T17 Arg2:T180\t\nR15\tIs_synon Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR16\tAnaphora Arg1:T21 Arg2:T16\t\nR17\tAnaphora Arg1:T21 Arg2:T180\t\nR18\tAnaphora Arg1:T23 Arg2:T26\t\n'}, {'text': 'Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized by the abnormal development of bone (osseousbo dysplasia).

In some individuals, other bones may also be affected, such as the ribs, pelvis, spinal column, and/or bones in the arms. Affected individuals will have some degree of short stature, which means that they are shorter than would otherwise be expected based on their gender and age. The medical definition states that short stature is two standard deviations or more below the mean for children of the same age and gender. The final height of affected individuals will vary. Researchers believe that alterations (mutations) in a gene result in Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome. However, they have not been able to find such a gene. Researchers also believe that the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Weismann-Netter-Stuhl syndrome is an extremely rare skeletal disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 70 people have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder’s original description in 1954.

Major symptoms may include coarse facial features, spine and eye deformities, behavior problems and mental retardation. Aspartylglycosaminuria occurs as a result of deficient activity of a particular enzyme, leading to the accumulation of metabolic products in the body. Aspartylglycosaminuria is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by normal development during the first months of life after which abnormal development begins to occur.  Diarrhea and infections that keep reoccurring are noticed. After the first few years facial features begin to get coarse which continues during the following years.  The skeleton may become deformed and the ocular lens may develop crystalline deposits.  Mental deterioration may begin to occur after age five and behavior problems are common.  Lung, heart and blood problems tend to occur in later years.  The patient may show mental retardation uneven development of the head and face with sagging cheeks, a wide nose and broad face.  The spine may be twisted (scoliosis) and the neck may be unusually short.  Adult stature is usually below normal.

Although the disorder was once thought to be under control throughout the world, malaria is a widespread infection especially in the tropics where certain types of mosquitos are becoming resistant to pesticides. The annual number of cases reported in the United States has increased in recent years. Malaria is most commonly transmitted through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito which is infected by a malaria parasite (Plasmodium).  Plasmodium Falciparum, Plasmodium Ovale, Plasmodium Malariae and Plasmodium Vivax are the four species of the parasite which can affect humans.  Additionally, transfusion of blood from an infected donor, or sharing contaminated needles may transmit the infection from one person to another.  In very rare cases, the disorder has been transmitted from an infected mother to a fetus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, malaria is uncommon in the United States where approximately 1,200 cases are diagnosed each year, usually having been contracted abroad.

This abnormal attachment is associated with progressive stretching and increased tension of the spinal cord as a child ages, potentially resulting in a variety of neurological and other symptoms. Due to the variation of the growth rate of the spinal cord and the spinal column, the progression of neurological signs and symptoms is highly variable. Some individuals present with tethered cord syndrome at birth (so-called congenital), while others develop the symptomatology in infancy or early childhood. Other individuals may not develop any noticeable symptoms until adulthood. Although some authors call these cases acquired, the majority of these cases are mostly developmental, corresponding to the progressive development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the filum terminale. The filum terminale is a strand of tissue that bridges the spinal cord tip and the tailbone (sacrum). The inelastic structures in children originated from defective closure of the neural tube (the precursor of the spinal cord) during embryonic development, eventually forming a condition known as spina bifida.

Although rare, it is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. Primary means that the cancer began at that site (in this case the eye) and did not spread there from another part of the body. In most people, this cancer arises in a part of the eye known as the uveal tract. The uveal tract is the colored (pigmented) layer of tissue that is found beneath the white of the eye (sclera) and is composed of normally pigmented cells and blood vessels.  In the front of the eye, the uvea is made up of the colored part of the eye (iris) and a circle of muscle tissue (ciliary body) that releases a transparent fluid (aqueous humor) into the eye and helps to control the shape of the lens. The largest area of the uveal tract is in the back part of the eye (choroid) which is located beneath the retina, the vision sensing portion of the eye. In most instances, ocular melanomas arise within the choroid. Ocular melanoma arises from cells called melanocytes, which are the cells of the body that produce pigment. Ocular melanoma is a cancerous (malignant) tumor that can potentially spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most often to the liver. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified. Ocular melanoma is the most common primary cancer affecting the eye. However, it is a rare disorder and is estimated to be diagnosed in about 2,500 people in the United States each year. The incidence is unknown, but one estimate places it at about 5-6 people per every 1,000,000 people in the general population. This cancer can affect men and women and individuals of all ethnic or racial groups. It occurs most commonly in older individuals with the highest incidence in the seventh and eighth decade of life. However, ocular melanoma has been reported in children as well. The disorder occurs more often in people who are fair skinned and have lighter colored eyes. The rate of occurrence is 8-10 times higher in Caucasian individuals compared to people of African descent.

Less often, the disorder can be associated with an underlying cancer (malignancy), usually a blood (hematologic) cancer such as certain types of leukemia; this is known as malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. The disorder can also result as a reaction to taking certain drugs, especially a drug known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; this is known as drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is treated with corticosteroids. Classical Sweet syndrome in adults affects women more often than men by as much as 15:1 by some estimates. This female preponderance has not been seen in malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Classical Sweet syndrome usually affects women between the ages of 30-50, but can be seen in individuals of any age including children. There is no gender predominance seen in children.

It appears to be associated with clotting factor VII in this population. Symptoms may include a yellowish color to the skin (jaundice), and a liver that is sometimes enlarged and tender. Jaundice, which is caused by excess bilirubin (bile pigment), is usually the only symptom of Dubin Johnson Syndrome.  Otherwise a physical examination is normal.  The disorder rarely appears before puberty.  Occasionally the patient may have an enlarged and tender liver and complain of weakness and a painful abdomen, but the liver will function normally. There may sometimes be a mild recurrence of the jaundice. Pregnancy or use of oral contraceptives may cause the disease to become apparent in women when no symptoms appeared previously. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Dubin Johnson Syndrome is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The disorder can occur in all races.  However, among Iranian, Iraqi and Moroccan Jews the incidence is as high as 1 in 1300.  In Japan an unusually high incidence of Dubin-Johnson Syndrome was found in an isolated area where there was a high rate of intermarriage.  Age at onset can be anytime between 10 weeks of age to 56 years. Treatment of Dubin Johnson Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. In many cases patients may require no treatment even though they have recurrent mild jaundice.

Acquired hemolytic anemias are non-genetic in origin. Idiopathic acquired autoimmune diseases occur when the body's natural defenses against invading organisms (e.g., lymphocytes, antibodies) destroy its own healthy tissues for no known reason. Normally, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a life span of approximately 120 days before being removed by the spleen. The severity of this type of anemia is determined by the life span of the red blood cell and by the rate at which these cells are replaced by the bone marrow. When acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs from unknown causes, it affects twice as many women as men, specifically women under 50 years old. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects elderly persons, and warm antibody hemolytic anemia can affect anyone at any age. Upon suspicion of hemolytic anemia, blood will be tested to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells to mature ones. If the ratio is high, hemolytic anemia is likely. Another blood test (Coombs test) is used to determine whether the amount of certain antibodies is higher than normal. If so, the diagnosis may be autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 5\tARPKD\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 67 72\tARPKD\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 254 259\tARPKD\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 413 418\tARPKD\n'}, {'text': 'Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most frequent cause of severe, persistent hypoglycemia in newborn babies, infants, and children.

Infection with any of these agents (i.e., Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses) may cause a constellation of similar symptoms in affected newborns.

Each infectious agent may also result in additional abnormalities that may be variable, depending upon a number of factors (e.g., stage of fetal development). TORCH Syndrome results from one of the TORCH agents having crossed the placenta during pregnancy.  These infectious agents include Toxoplasma gondii, the single-celled microorganism (protozoa) responsible for Toxoplasmosis; rubella virus; cytomegalovirus; and herpes simplex viruses.  (Note: According to some reports, the acronym “TORCH” is sometimes modified to the term “STORCH” to include syphilis, a disease that may result in symptoms similar to those associated with the other TORCH agents.  Syphilis is caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum.  In addition, TORCH may encompass other disease-causing agents, such as varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus responsible for chickenpox, and parvovirus.) TORCH syndrome may affect a developing fetus or newborn, potentially resulting in miscarriage, delayed fetal growth and maturation (intrauterine growth retardation), or early delivery. Treatment of newborns and infants with TORCH Syndrome is based upon the specific causative agent, the stage of fetal development when infection initially occurred, the severity of the infection and associated symptoms and findings, and/or other factors. For infants with toxoplasmosis, treatment may include administration of the medication pyrimethamine with sulfadiazine. Herpes simplex may be treated with the antiviral agent acyclovir.

Instead of having a separate pulmonary artery, to carry blood to the lungs, and aorta, to carry blood to the rest of the body, a baby with truncus arteriosus has just one blood vessel leaving the heart which then branches into other blood vessels. Blood from both ventricles of the heart is mixed, resulting in a situation in which some oxygen-rich blood travels needlessly back to the lungs and some oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body. Babies with this condition may have a bluish tint (cyanosis) to their skin, lips, and fingernails. In most cases, truncus arteriosus occurs in conjunction with a missing upper portion of the wall between the ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect). The exact cause of truncus arteriosus is not known.  It has been suggested that some cases may develop due to the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).  The malformation is the result of an error in embryonic development.  Approximately 35 percent of children with this disorder also have DiGeorge syndrome, which is a severe congenital immune deficiency disorder involving the thymus and parathyroid glands.

Multiple distinctive skin lesions are usually characteristic of this disorder and are often present at birth or present during early childhood. Lesions in the gastrointestinal tract frequently become apparent during childhood or early adulthood. The lesions are multifocal venous malformations, resulting from abnormal embryonic blood vessel development. BRBNS is characterized by soft, elevated lesions on the skin or just under the skin that are dark blue, red, purple-red or black in color. The venous malformations may be tender, contain blood and be easily compressed and are usually located on the upper limbs, trunk and soles of the feet but can occur anywhere. The lesions increase in size and become more apparent over time but have not been reported to become cancerous. The organ system most commonly affected by BRBNS is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly the small intestine. The lesions in the GI tract often bleed and can lead to mild or severe anemia. Iron replacement and/or frequent blood transfusions may be required. The GI lesions can also cause an obstruction or blockage (intussusception) of part of the bowel. Skeletal abnormalities and venous malformations in muscle are sometimes associated with BRBNS. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is sporadic.  Although families have been described in which the condition follows autosomal dominant inheritance, these families actually have other multifocal venous malformations. Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature. BRBNS is diagnosed by physical examination and a procedure in which the GI tract is illuminated and visualized (endoscopy).

The urachus is a canal that exists when the fetus is developing before birth. This canal runs from the bladder of the fetus to the belly button (umbilicus). It drains the urinary bladder of the fetus. Between the fourth and fifth month of pregnancy, this canal breaks down (degenerates) into a fibrous band of tissue called a ligament. This ligament runs from the belly button to the top of the bladder and is called the median umbilical ligament. Sometimes, there are tissue remnants of the urachus in adults (about 1/3 of adults have urachal tissue remnants). This usually does not cause any problems. However, sometimes these remnants can potentially become cancerous (malignant). Urachal cancer will often extend into surrounding structures like the bladder, and can potentially spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. The exact, underlying cause of urachal cancer is not fully understood. Surgery is the most common treatment option. Urachal cancer is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence of this form of cancer in the general population is unknown.

Epidermal nevi are overgrowths of structures and tissue of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. The different types of epidermal nevi can vary in size, number, location, distribution and appearance. Neurological abnormalities that can be associated with ENSs can include seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and paralysis of one side of the body (hemiparesis). Skeletal abnormalities can include abnormal curvature of the spine, malformation of the hip and abnormalities of the arms and legs (e.g., underdevelopment or absence or overgrowth of limbs). Ocular abnormalities may include cataracts, clouding (opacity) of the cornea or partial absence of tissue of the iris or retina (colobomas). Endocrine abnormalities such as vitamin D-resistant rickets have been associated with Schimmelpenning syndrome. The specific symptoms and severity of ENSs can vary greatly from one person to another. Most ENSs occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically), most likely due to a gene mutation that occurs after fertilization (postzygotic mutation) and is present in only some of the cells of the body (mosaic pattern). Epidermal nevi (including as an isolated finding) have been reported to occur in approximately 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births. The percentage of individuals with epidermal nevi who also have extra-cutaneous malformations is much lower but likewise unknown. The prevalence and incidence of individual ENSs is unknown. A diagnosis of an epidermal nevus syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history and a thorough clinical evaluation. In some cases, a small sample of affected skin may be taken for microscopic study (biopsy). Additional tests may be required to detect the presence and extent of associated symptoms. Such tests include a skeletal survey, chest x-rays and specialized imaging techniques to evaluate the brain. Such imaging techniques may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whether a child with an epidermal nevus should undergo such imaging techniques is controversial. Some researchers believe that these tests should be avoided unless there are clinical signs of central nervous involvement. In three of the well-defined ENSs (type 2 segmental Cowden disease, García-Hafner-Happle syndrome, CHILD syndrome), molecular testing is now possible.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 21\tCicatricial alopecias\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 97 126\tprimary cicatricial alopecias\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 211 242\tsecondary cicatricial alopecias\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 427 448\tcicatricial alopecias\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 495 516\tcicatricial alopecias\nT6\tSIGN 525 537;565 585\tinflammation of the hair follicle\nT7\tSIGN 659 703\tstem cells and sebaceous gland are destroyed\nT8\tSIGN 779 798\tpermanent hair loss\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 800 821\tCicatricial alopecias\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\n'}, {'text': 'Achondroplasia appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.

A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, movement of a body part. Tremor may be seen as involuntary shaking or trembling of the affected area. In individuals with ET, other motor symptoms may be present including an unsteady manner of walking due to an inability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia). In some cases, affected individuals may also develop a variety of non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment, depression or anxiety. ET can occur in childhood or adulthood. The exact, underlying cause of ET is not fully understood. In some cases, the disorder runs in families; in others, it occurs in individuals with no previous family history. The causes of ET are most likely many, which means that several factors, such as genetic and environmental ones, may each play a role in the development of the disorder. ET is the most prevalent tremor disorder and is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency in the general population. An estimated 7 million Americans have ET. The incidence of ET increases with age and more than 4% of the population over the age of 40 has ET. Although the disorder is most common in older adults, it can affect individuals of any age including middle-aged or young adults and children. In rare cases, it has been reported during infancy. Individuals with a family history of ET tend to experience earlier onset of tremor. ET affects both men and women and individuals of every race or ethnicity. A diagnosis of ET is based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. There is no specific test to diagnose ET.

These may include marked smallness of the head (microcephaly), sloping of the forehead, widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), and other malformations, resulting in a distinctive facial appearance. NLS is also typically characterized by abnormal accumulations of fluid in tissues throughout the body (generalized edema); permanent flexion and immobilization of multiple joints (flexion contractures); other limb malformations; and/or abnormalities of the brain, skin, genitals, kidneys, and/or heart. NLS appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in three siblings in 1971 (Neu, RL) as well as three siblings in another family in 1972 (Laxova, R), over 30 additional cases have been reported.

The disorder is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and physical features that vary greatly in range and severity. In many affected individuals, associated abnormalities include a distinctive facial appearance; a broad or webbed neck; a low posterior hairline; a typical chest deformity and short stature. Characteristic features of the head and facial (craniofacial) area may include widely set eyes (ocular hypertelorism); skin folds that may cover the eyes' inner corners (epicanthal folds); drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis); a small jaw (micrognathia); a depressed nasal root; a short nose with broad base; and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears (pinnae). Distinctive skeletal malformations are also typically present, such as abnormalities of the breastbone (sternum), curvature of the spine (kyphosis and/or scoliosis), and outward deviation of the elbows (cubitus valgus). Many infants with Noonan syndrome also have heart (cardiac) defects, such as obstruction of proper blood flow from the lower right chamber of the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valvular stenosis) and thickening of the ventricular heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Additional abnormalities may include malformations of certain blood and lymph vessels, blood clotting and platelet deficiencies, learning difficulties or mild intellectual disability, failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism) by the first year of life in affected males, and/or other symptoms and findings. Noonan syndrome appears to affect more males than females and is thought to affect approximately one in 1,000 to one in 2,500 people. However, other reports indicate that the disorder may affect more than one in 1,000 newborns in the general population. Since Noonan syndrome was originally reported in 1883 (O. Kobylinski) and more thoroughly described in 1963 (J.A. Noonan and D.A. Ehmke), more than 500 patients shave been discussed in the medical literature.

The disorder is not genetic in origin. Instead of ligaments, the spleen is attached by a stalk-like tissue supplied with blood vessels (vascular pedicle). If the pedicle is twisted in the course of the movement of the spleen, the blood supply may be interrupted or blocked (ischemia) to the point of severe damage to the blood vessels (infarction). Because there is little or nothing to hold it in place the spleen ""wanders"" in the lower abdomen or pelvis where it may be mistaken for an unidentified abdominal mass. The diagnosis of wanderin. spleen is suspected when the pain associated with an abdominal mass can be relieved by moving it toward the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, the normal position of the spleen. Wandering spleen may be confirmed by specialized examinations such as ultrasonography and CT scan that enable the physician to view the structure, size, and placement of the spleen within the abdomen or pelvis. Specialized ultrasound tests (i.e., Doppler studies) may show impaired blood flow in and out of the spleen. Radioisotopic scanning (technetium 99 sulfur colloid scan), another imaging test, allows the physician to determine how well the liver and spleen are functioning. Low spleen function (functional asplenia) may suggest that the organ is damaged as a result of arterial obstruction (infarct)."\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 25\tPapillon-Lefèvre syndrome\nT2\tANAPHOR 232 244\tthe disorder\nT3\tSIGN 396 414\tSkin abnormalities\nT4\tANAPHOR 431 444\tthis disorder\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\n'}, {'text': 'The exact cause of megalocornea intellectual disability syndrome is unknown.

Normally, the red blood cells have a life span of approximately 120 days before they are destroyed by the spleen. In individuals with CAHA, the red blood cells are destroyed prematurely and the rate of production of new cells in the bone marrow can no longer compensate for their loss. The severity of the anemia is determined by the length of time that the red blood cells survive and by the rate at which the bone marrow continues to create new red blood cell production. Although cold antibody hemolytic anemia is known to be an autoimmune disorder, neither its exact underlying cause nor the process by which the disorder becomes apparent is fully understood.  Autoimmune disorders occur when the body’s natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Cold antibody hemolytic anemia most commonly affects older people.  The incidence of CAHA in the general population is about 1 in 80,000.  There appears to be a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of CAHA, with a male to female ratio of 2 to 3.  Those individuals with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this disorder. In order to differentiate hemolytic anemia from the other anemias, doctors examine the patient's blood to determine the proportion of immature red blood cells, since the number of young cells is increased in hemolytic anemia. The patient is also examined to check for spleen or liver enlargement. An antiglobulin test (Coomb's reaction) may be performed as the initial screening exam to detect the presence of immunoglobulin or complement on the red-cell membrane and to determine the specific class of immunoglobulin or complement present. In the case of cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the Coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 17 27\tmeningioma\nT2\tSIGN 263 271\tseizures\nT3\tSIGN 275 296\tneurological deficits\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 587 597\tmeningioma\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 749 759\tMeningioma\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 839 850\tmeningiomas\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 1164 1174\tmeningioma\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\n'}, {'text': 'Pontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) are a group of rare heterogeneous conditions characterized by prenatal development of an abnormally small cerebellum and brain stem, which is usually associated with profound psychomotor retardation.

In individuals with KFS, there is abnormal union or fusion of two or more bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) within the neck (cervical vertebrae). Duane syndrome is characterized by limitation or absence of certain horizontal eye movements; retraction or ""drawing back"" of the eyeball into the eye cavity (orbit) upon attempting to look inward; and, in some cases, abnormal deviation of one eye in relation to the other (strabismus). In some affected individuals, additional physical abnormalities may also be present. In most cases, Wildervanck syndrome appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). As mentioned above, Wildervanck syndrome primarily affects females. Since the disorder was originally described in 1952 (L.S. Wildervanck), almost 90 cases have been reported in the medical literature. According to some reports, approximately one percent of females with hearing impairment may be affected by Wildervanck syndrome. Wildervanck syndrome may be detected at birth or during the first year of life based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized tests. Diagnostic studies may include advanced imaging techniques, such as computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of internal structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to form detailed cross-sectional images of certain organs and tissues. Such techniques may help to detect and characterize abnormalities of the inner ear, union or fusion of certain bones of the spinal column (e.g., cervical vertebrae), possible impingement of vertebrae on the spinal cord, or other abnormalities potentially associated with the disorder. In addition, in some individuals with Wildervanck syndrome, exploratory surgery may be conducted to detect malformations of the middle ear (exploratory tympanotomy).

It is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which is a group of related cancers that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas). The lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease. It consists of a network of tubular channels (lymph vessels) that drain a thin watery fluid known as lymph from different areas of the body into the bloodstream. Lymph accumulates in the tiny spaces between tissue cells and contains proteins, fats, and certain white blood cells known as lymphocytes. As lymph moves through the lymphatic system, it is filtered by a network of small structures known as lymph nodes that help to remove microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) and other foreign bodies. Groups of lymph nodes are located throughout the body, including, but not limited to, the neck, under the arms (axillae), at the elbows, and in the chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymphocytes are stored within lymph nodes and may also be found in other lymphatic tissues. In addition to the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system includes the spleen, which filters worn-out red blood cells and produces lymphocytes, and bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside the cavities of bones that manufactures blood cells. Lymphatic tissue or circulating lymphocytes may also be located in other regions of the body. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes (B-cells), which may produce specific antibodies to ""neutralize"" certain invading microorganisms, and T-lymphocytes (T-cells), which may directly destroy microorganisms or cancer cells, or assist in the activities of other lymphocytes. Follicular lymphoma affects both men and women, but is slightly more common in women. This form of cancer is found all over the world and can affect people of all races. It is less common in individuals of Asian or African heritage than it is in other ethnicities. The mean age at diagnosis is 65. In the United States and Western Europe, follicular lymphoma is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for about 30%-35% of people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and almost 75% of people with indolent forms of lymphoma. Each year, 15-20,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Pediatric follicular lymphoma is extremely rare variant that makes up only 1-2% of all malignant lymphomas in children.

There are two types of subacute cerebellar degeneration: paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, which sometimes precedes the diagnosis of cancer, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration, caused by a lack of the vitamin B-1 (thiamine). These two types share symptoms but not the same cause. In paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, the average age of onset is 50, with males affected more often than females.  This form of cerebellar degeneration may precede cancer.  Alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration affects alcoholics and people with thiamine deficiency.

It is characterized by a thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue (inelastic collagen) and elastic fibers. The normal heart has four chambers. Two chambers, known as atria, are separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum. The other two chambers, known as ventricles, are also separated by a septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Fewer than 1 percent of infants and children with congenital heart disease are diagnosed with this disorder.  A 1964 study suggested an incidence of 1 in 5,000 live births.  However, in the United States there has been a marked reduction in incidence since then for reasons that are not known.  The disorder is extremely rare. The diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis is confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, including a physical examination that may reveal signs of respiratory distress (i.e., moist rales) and galloping heart rhythms. Radiographic studies (x-ray) of the chest typically reveal abnormal enlargement of the heart, especially the left ventricle (ventricular hypertrophy). Damage to the heart may be demonstrated by measuring the electrical activity of the heart (i.e., electrocardiogram [EKG]). This test may show subtle changes (i.e., S-T segment and T-wave changes) that strongly suggest damage to the heart that is characteristic of EFE.

Ectodermal dysplasias typically affect the hair, teeth, nails, and/or skin. Setleis syndrome is characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the facial area that may be apparent at birth (congenital). Most affected infants have multiple, scar-like, circular depressions on both temples (bitemporal). These marks closely resemble those made when forceps are used to assist delivery. In addition, affected infants may have puffy, wrinkled skin around the eyes (periorbital) and/or abnormalities of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and eyelids. Infants with Setleis syndrome may be missing eyelashes on both the upper and lower lids, or they may have multiple rows of lashes on the upper lids but none on the lower lids. In addition, in some cases, the bridge of the nose may appear flat, while the tip may appear unusually rounded (bulbous). Affected infants often have loose, excessive (redundant) skin, particularly in the area of the nose and the chin. Due to such facial abnormalities, infants with Setleis syndrome may have an aged and/or ""leonine"" (lion-like) appearance. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Most cases of Setleis syndrome are thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait. Setleis syndrome is an extremely rare inherited disorder that, in theory, affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 20 cases have been reported in the medical literature.

Occasionally biliary tract cancers are diagnosed incidentally when a CT or MRI scan is done for another reason, or when the gallbladder is removed due to symptomatic gallstones. Patients may have non-specific symptoms including weight loss, abdominal pain, fevers, night sweats and fatigue. Distal and perihilar cholangiocarcinomas or gallbladder cancers more frequently cause patients to develop jaundice due to tumor or lymph nodes blocking a major bile duct [4]. Most cases of biliary tract cancer are sporadic, with no identifiable predisposing patient factors. There are several known risk factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma however, including liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B and C, biliary tract stones, liver fluke infections, a congenital anatomical abnormality called a choledochal cyst and the chronic condition of inflamed bile ducts also called primary sclerosing cholangitis. Exposure to some industrial chemicals such as nitrosamines, dioxin, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls are also thought to increase an individual’s risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.  In the USA, gallbladder cancer is commonly associated with the presence of long standing gallstones resulting in calcification of the gallbladder wall or “porcelain gallbladder”.  Gallbladder polyps are also associated with increased risk of gallbladder cancer. The incidence of bile duct cancers differs worldwide, likely reflecting both differing genetic predisposition and variable exposure to known risk factors[5]. Approximately 12,000 new affected individuals of bile duct cancers are diagnosed in the USA each year, of which over 9,000 are gallbladder cancers and distal/perihilar cholangiocarcinomas and 3,000 are intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas [6]. The overall incidence of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is 1 person per 100,000 per year. The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the United States is approximately 0.7 per 100,000. During the last 30 years, it appears that the incidence of biliary tract cancers in the United States is increasing [7]. This increase may be due in part to increased recognition of the diagnosis of biliary cancer, cases which may previously have been classified as cancer of unknown origin. Gallbladder cancer is more common in women than in men, and in some countries the rates are three times higher for women. Certain geographic areas are characterized by a high incidence of gallbladder cancer, including Chile, Bolivia and India. A high incidence also has been documented in North American Native Americans and Mexican Americans [7]. A diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer is made based on identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, clinical examination and several specialized tests including blood test, imaging tests and endoscopic procedures. Either CT or MRI scans may be used to assess the tumor size and to look for blockage of the bile ducts and sites of spread [9, 10]. ERCP may be used to insert a stent into a blocked bile duct to relieve jaundice. A biopsy is usually required to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and may be obtained by a CT or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy [11]. Some patients with gallbladder cancer are incidentally diagnosed following elective removal of their gallbladder due to gallstones, where the cancer is only detected on pathologic examination.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 22\tMarcus Gunn phenomenon\nT2\tDISEASE 33 49\tgenetic disorder\nT3\tANAPHOR 84 86\tIt\nT4\tSIGN 111 188\tmovement of one upper eyelid in a rapid rising motion each time the jaw moves\nT5\tSIGN 196 213\teye abnormalities\nT6\tSIGN 218 237\tvision difficulties\nT7\tANAPHOR 273 288\tthis phenomenon\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 303 325\tMarcus Gunn phenomenon\nT9\tDISEASE 336 352\tgenetic disorder\nT10\tANAPHOR 372 374\tIt\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T70\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tIs_a Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\n'}, {'text': 'Eosinophilic gastroenteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum.

The reaction may be caused by a drug allergy, by insect stings or bites, by desensitization injections (allergy shots) or ingestion of certain foods (particularly eggs, shellfish, nuts or fruits) by people who are allergic to these substances.  In some cases (such as reactions to strawberries), the reaction may occur only after overindulgence, and possibly result from direct toxic histamine release into the blood.  If acute angioedema is recurrent, progressive, and never associated with urticaria, a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be suspected. Children from 2 to 7 years are most commonly, but not exclusively, affected by papular urticaria. Children are especially susceptible in the summertime when the insect population increases.  It is more rare in adults, perhaps in part because adults build up a tolerance.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 19 39\tEisenmenger syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 122 135\tDown syndrome\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 215 235\tEisenmenger syndrome\nT4\tDISEASE 587 599\theart defect\nT5\tSIGN 587 599\theart defect\nT6\tSIGN 604 611;629 656\traising high pressures in the lungs\nR1\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\n'}, {'text': '"Mosaic trisomy 9 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the entire 9th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body.

An enzyme deficiency will make the body unable to produce one or more of these hormones, which in turn will result in the overproduction of another type of hormone precursor in order to compensate for the loss. The most common form of CAH, 21 hydroxylase deficiency, affects approximately 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the United States and Europe.

During lymphoscintigraphy, a radioactively labeled colloid substance is injected intradermally into either the hands or feet. The time required for the tracer to be transported from the point of injection to the regional lymph nodes is recorded. In congenital lymphedema, the tracer may move\xa0sluggishly or not move from the site of injection. During an ultrasound, reflected sound waves create an image of the developing fetus. An ultrasound is used to rule out other conditions. A Doppler ultrasound can evaluate venous conditions such as varicose veins and venous blood clots. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. An MRI is used to detect findings characteristic of hereditary lymphedema including swelling (edema), a mass surrounded by a sac containing lymph fluid (lymphocele), and the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis).\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 15\tOcular melanoma\nT2\tDISEASE 45 51\tcancer\nT3\tANAPHOR 131 133\tit\nT4\tDISEASE 153 178\tprimary cancer of the eye\nT5\tDISEASE 213 219\tcancer\nT6\tDISEASE 339 345\tcancer\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 982 998\tocular melanomas\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 1025 1040\tOcular melanoma\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 1133 1148\tOcular melanoma\nT10\tSIGN 1165 1174;1176 1202;1211 1222\tmalignant tumor that can potentially metastasize\nT11\tANAPHOR 1296 1309\tthis disorder\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 1369 1384\tOcular melanoma\nT13\tDISEASE 1404 1436\tprimary cancer affecting the eye\nT14\tANAPHOR 1447 1449\tit\nT15\tANAPHOR 1683 1694\tThis cancer\nT16\tDISEASE 1688 1694\tcancer\nT17\tANAPHOR 1768 1770\tIt\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 1891 1906\tocular melanoma\nT19\tANAPHOR 1946 1958\tThe disorder\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 2147 2162\tOcular melanoma\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 2206 2214\tmelanoma\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 2239 2247\tmelanoma\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tIs_a Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tIs_a Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tIs_a Arg1:T15 Arg2:T160\t\nR11\tAnaphora Arg1:T18 Arg2:T190\t\n'}, {'text': 'Meningitis is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord.

Other forms may occur due to fungal, parasitic, or viral infections. In some instances, it is thought that vasculitis may be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Because of the wide range of symptoms and body systems involved, an extensive history and physical exam is needed before a clear diagnosis of the type of vasculitis can be made.

Adrenal insufficiency leads to weight loss, lack of appetite (anorexia), weakness, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure (hypotension). Because these symptoms are so general, the diagnosis is sometimes delayed or missed entirely. For that reason, some clinicians believe the disorder to be more common than previously thought. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency most often occur in adults, but the disorder may also be diagnosed in infancy. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers. When ACTH deficiency is suspected, blood samples are taken for analysis, especially of the level of cortisol in the blood.

Some affected individuals may also have an abnormally large head (macrocephaly), a relatively prominent forehead, and/or other physical abnormalities associated with the disorder. In addition, in about 10 percent of cases, mild mental retardation may be present. Hypochondroplasia appears to affect females and males in relatively equal numbers.

It is in the group of disorders known as cerebral organic acidemias. Individuals with this condition have deficiency or absence of GCDH enzyme that is involved in the lysine metabolism. GCDH deficiency results in increased concentrations of potentially neurotoxic metabolites, glutaric acid (GA), 3-hydroxy glutaric acid (3-OH-GA) and glutaconic acid within body tissues, especially within the brain. Two arbitrary biochemical subtypes have been defined, high (HE) and low excretors (LE), depending on the amount of GA in the urine. Newborns may show unspecific clinical signs like enlarged head circumference (macrocephaly) or decreased muscle tone (hypotonia).  Without treatment, most affected children develop an acute encephalopathic crisis following febrile illness episodes or other catabolic conditions resulting in bilateral striatal injury and consequently, dystonic movement disorder. Cognitive outcome has not been systematically studied, but severe cognitive dysfunction is rarely seen. Sometimes babies with GA1 have been mistaken to have been abused because they present with subdural and/or retinal hemorrhages. GA1 is included in the newborn screening panel in a growing number of countries which is essential for early intervention.  Importantly, patients with the low excreting phenotype may be missed by newborn screening. GA1 is a rare inborn error of metabolism that affects males as often as females.

Associated symptoms and physical findings may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. Such variability may depend upon the specific length and location of the duplicated (trisomic) portion of chromosome 4p as well as other factors. However, many affected infants may have feeding and breathing difficulties, characteristic malformations of the head and facial (craniofacial) area, and abnormalities of the hands and feet. Additional features may include other skeletal defects, genital abnormalities in affected males, or heart (cardiac) defects. Trisomy 4p is also characterized by severe mental retardation. Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers.  Trisomy for the short arm of chromosome 4 was originally described in 1970 (Wilson MG) and delineated as a distinct clinical syndrome in 1977 (Gonzalez CH).

With time, further symptoms may include progressive weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), language problems (if on the left side of the brain) and intellectual disabilities. The exact cause of this disorder is not known. The two leading ideas are that the brain inflammation might be a reaction of a foreign antigen (infection) or an autoimmune disease limited to one side of the brain resulting in brain damage. It occurs mostly, but not always, in children between the ages of two and ten years, and in many patients the course of the disease is most severe during the first 8 to 12 months. After the peak inflammatory response is reached, the progression of this disorder appears to slow or stop and the patient is left with permanent neurological deficits. Rasmussen encephalitis mostly affects children ten years of age and younger. It is unusual to affect children under two years of age. Adolescents and young adults in much smaller proportions are also affected. There may be a history of some prior mild cold or flu prior to the onset of the seizures.

Bone marrow, the soft spongy material found inside certain bones, produces the main blood cells of the body -red cells, white cells, and platelets. Anemia is a condition characterized by the low levels of circulating, red blood cells. Red blood cells are released from the marrow into the bloodstream where they travel throughout the body delivering oxygen to tissue. A deficiency in healthy, fully-matured red blood cells can result in fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor), lightheadedness and additional findings. Megaloblastic anemia has several different causes - deficiencies of either cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate (vitamin B9) are the two most common causes. These vitamins play an essential role in the production of red blood cells. Megaloblastic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. It can occur in individuals of any racial or ethnic background. Because the causes of megaloblastic anemia vary and because some individuals may not exhibit any obvious symptoms (asymptomatic), determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. A diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of blood tests. Blood tests may reveal the abnormally large, misshapen red blood cells that characterize megaloblastic anemia. Blood tests can also confirm cobalamin or folate deficiency as the cause of megaloblastic anemia.

This characteristic cough gives the disease its common name, Whooping Cough. During the convalescent stage, episodes of coughing are less frequent and symptoms improve. The incidence of Pertussis has diminished greatly with widespread use of the DPT vaccine (Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus), but in certain areas of the United States outbreaks have occurred periodically in recent years. Pertussis is an infectious disease caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus, Bordetella pertussis.  Pertussis is a highly contagious disease via droplets in the air from the respiratory tract of infected individuals.  Transmission occurs during the catarrhal stage and during the first 2 to 3 weeks of the paroxysmal phase. The diagnosis of Pertussis may be confirmed by isolating the organism Bordetella pertussis from the sputum of an affected individual.

Treatments for chronic forms of the disorder include corticosteroid drugs such as dapsone and isotretinoin, which is the synthetic form of retinoic acid (related to vitamin A).\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 16\tRoberts syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 78 94\tRoberts syndrome\n'}, {'text': 'Sialidosis, also known as mucolipidosis type I, is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme neuraminidase (sometimes referred to as sialidase). Deficiency of neuraminidase results in the abnormal accumulation of toxic materials in the body. Sialidosis is divided into two types (i.e., type I and type II). Sialidosis type I usually becomes apparent during the second decade of life with the development of sudden involuntary muscle contractions (myoclonus), distinctive red spots (cherry-red macules) in the eyes, and sometimes additional neurological findings. Sialidosis type II is usually more severe than sialidosis type I. Type II often begins during infancy or later during childhood and is characterized by cherry-red macules, mildly coarse facial features, skeletal malformations and mild cognitive impairment. Sialidosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Sialidosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of sialidosis in the general population is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 4.2 million individuals in the Australian population. Another estimate placed the incidence at 1-4 individuals per 200,000 of the general population.

The disease may affect the patient’s ability to engage in strenuous exercise and may make such activities as climbing stairs or walking up a steep walkway difficult. Onset is gradual, typically taking place over several weeks to many months. There is often a progression of symptoms whereby the shoulder muscles, muscles of the feet & hands, speech & swallowing muscles and eye muscles are affected in a stepwise fashion. The symptoms progress more quickly when LEMS is associated with cancer. Most LEMS patients also exhibit the following symptoms (sometimes called autonomic symptoms): dry mouth, dry eyes, constipation, impotence, and decreased sweating. LEMS patients with or without cancer may also undergo significant weight loss. The tendon reflexes are diminished or absent on examination. Hence, in summary, LEMS is often described as a clinical “triad” of proximal muscle weakness, autonomic symptoms and reduced tendon reflexes. The estimated worldwide prevalence of LEMS is about 2.8 per million, making it a rare disease. There are approximately 400 known cases of LEMS in the United States. When LEMS is associated with SCLC, the patients tend to be older and are more likely to be men than women. The average age of onset of SCLC is around 60 years of age. Approximately 3% of SCLC patients develop LEMS, but clinical symptoms of LEMS usually precede the SCLC diagnosis (sometimes by many years). When LEMS is not related to cancer, the syndrome may occur at any age, and the typical onset is about 35 years of age.

If left untreated, affected individuals inevitably develop cancer of the colon and/or rectum at a relatively young age. FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and caused by abnormalities (mutations) in the APC gene. Mutations in the APC gene cause a group of polyposis conditions that have overlapping features: familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome and attenuated FAP. Familial adenomatous polyposis affects males and females in equal numbers. It occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals in the United States and accounts for about 0.5% of all cases of colorectal cancer. One estimate suggests that familial adenomatous polyposis affects 50,000 American families. According to national registries, familial adenomatous polyposis occurs in 2.29-3.2 per 100,000 individuals. Classical FAP is diagnosed clinically when an individual has 100 or more adenomatous colorectal polyps (typically occurring by the third decade of life) or fewer than 100 polyps and a relative with FAP. Genetic testing for mutations in the APC gene is available to confirm the diagnosis of FAP and the associated conditions. Younger individuals may have fewer polyps.

Zellweger spectrum disorders can affect most organs of the body. Neurological deficits, loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), hearing loss, vision problems, liver dysfunction, and kidney abnormalities are common findings. Zellweger spectrum disorders often result in severe, life-threatening complications early during infancy. Some individuals with milder forms have lived into adulthood. Zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.

Peroxisomes are very small, membrane-bound structures within the gel-like fluid (cytoplasm) of cells that play a vital role in numerous biochemical processes in the body. PBDs are subdivided into the three Zellweger spectrum disorders and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.\xa0 Zellweger spectrum disorders are usually apparent at birth.

The disorder is characterized by the abnormal clustering of certain white blood cells (hypereosinophilia) in the blood and tissues, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), and the development of inflammatory nodular lesions called granulomas (granulomatosis). Most affected individuals have a history of allergy. In addition, asthma and other associated lung (pulmonary) abnormalities (i.e., pulmonary infiltrates) often precede the development of the generalized (systemic) symptoms and findings seen in Churg-Strauss syndrome by as little as six months or as much as two decades. Asthma, a chronic respiratory disorder, is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the lungs' airways, causing difficulties breathing (dyspnea), coughing, the production of a high-pitched whistling sound while breathing (wheezing), and/or other symptoms and findings. Churg-Strauss syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers, although some reports suggest that males may be affected slightly more often. The disorder can affect individuals of almost any age and has ranged from 15 to 70 years of age. Most cases occur in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. The estimated mean annual incidence is 2.4 individuals per million. Some researchers believe that Churg-Strauss syndrome is underdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population.\n", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 14\tSweet syndrome\nT2\tSIGN 51 56\tfever\nT3\tSIGN 83 87\trash\nT4\tSIGN 107 147\tmultiple tender, red or bluish-red bumps\nT5\tSIGN 151 158\tlesions\nT6\tSIGN 166 173\tlesions\nT7\tSIGN 367 376\tarthritis\nT8\tSIGN 396 411;486 505\tinflammation of the internal organs\nT9\tSIGN 465 479\tconjunctivitis\nT10\tANAPHOR 548 560\tthe disorder\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 599 624\tidiopathic Sweet syndrome\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 649 673\tclassical Sweet syndrome\nT13\tANAPHOR 687 699\tthe disorder\nT14\tDISEASE 737 743\tcancer\nT15\tDISEASE 768 773;788 794\tblood cancer\nT16\tRAREDISEASE 820 828\tleukemia\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 847 883\tmalignancy-associated Sweet syndrome\nT18\tANAPHOR 885 897\tThe disorder\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 1036 1063\tdrug-induced Sweet syndrome\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 1065 1079\tSweet syndrome\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 1113 1137\tClassical Sweet syndrome\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 1267 1288;1305 1319\tmalignancy-associated Sweet syndrome\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 1292 1319\tdrug-induced Sweet syndrome\nT24\tRAREDISEASE 1321 1345\tClassical Sweet syndrome\nT25\tRAREDISEASE 1538 1552\tSweet syndrome\nT26\tRAREDISEASE 1691 1705\tSweet syndrome\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tIs_a Arg1:T10 Arg2:T25\t\nR13\tIs_synon Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR14\tIs_a Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR15\tIs_a Arg1:T17 Arg2:T13\t\nR16\tIs_a Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\n'}, {'text': 'Triploidy is a rare chromosomal abnormality. Triploidy is the presence of an additional set of chromosomes in the cell for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46 chromosomes per cell. The extra set of chromosomes originates either from the father or the mother during fertilization. Infants with triploidy usually are miscarried early in the pregnancy. If the pregnancy continues to term, the infant dies within the first days of life. A few affected individuals have been reported to have survived to adulthood, but suffered from developmental delay, learning difficulties, seizures, hearing loss and other abnormalities. Those that survive have mosaic triploidy, meaning that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other cells have 69 chromosomes per cell.  Infants affected with complete triploidy suffer from growth restriction and multiple birth defects. Triploidy is the presence of a complete additional set of chromosomes. The triplication of the chromosomes is caused by the fertilization of an egg by two sperms, or the fertilization of an egg by a sperm that has an extra set of chromosomes or by the fertilization of an egg that has an extra set of chromosomes by a normal sperm. This disorder does not run in families and is not associated with maternal or paternal age. Triploidy accounts for 1-3 percent of all pregnancies. The condition occurs slightly more often in males than females; it is estimated that 2/3 of triploid pregnancies are male. The presence of multiple major malformations, low amniotic fluid and/or growth restriction on fetal ultrasound during pregnancy raises the suspicion of triploidy. The diagnosis can be made during pregnancy by chromosome analysis (karyotyping) of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). The diagnosis can be confirmed after birth by chromosome analysis of tissue (skin) obtained from the affected infant. Triploidy cannot be diagnosed by chromosome microarray testing. The accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal (cff) DNA in the diagnosis of triploidy is still being studied. Abnormal levels of specific maternal blood proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, estriol and pregnancy-assisted plasma protein-A have been associated with an increased risk for triploidy.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 15 31\ttrichotillomania\nT2\tSIGN 107 116\thair loss\nT3\tSIGN 269 278\thair loss\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\n'}, {'text': 'Aceruloplasminemia is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.

The retinas are the light-sensitive linings of the insides of the eyes. In infants born prematurely, the blood vessels that supply the retinas are not yet completely developed. Although blood vessel growth continues after birth, these vessels may develop in an abnormal, disorganized pattern, known as ROP. In some affected infants, the changes associated with ROP spontaneously subside. However, in others, ROP may lead to bleeding, scarring of the retina, retinal detachment and visual loss. Even in cases in which ROP changes cease or regress spontaneously, affected children may have an increased risk of certain eye (ocular) abnormalities, including nearsightedness, misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), and/or future retinal detachment. The two major risk factors for ROP are a low birth weight and premature delivery. ROP is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in infants in many industrialized and “middle-income” countries. As noted above, an increased incidence of ROP in the 1940s and 1950s was shown to be due to the use of high concentrations of supplemental oxygen in premature infants. The number of cases decreased with measures to monitor oxygen blood levels carefully. However, with modern advances in care and technology in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), the incidence of ROP has increased as more premature infants of lower birth weights survive. Careful control of blood oxygen levels reduces the risk of ROP without compromising measures necessary to sustain life. Again, supplementary oxygen alone does not appear to be sufficient for the development of ROP.

In rare cases, both sides of the face are affected. In some people, atrophy may also affect the limbs usually on the same side of the body as the facial atrophy. The severity and specific symptoms of Parry-Romberg syndrome are highly variable from one person to another. Additional symptoms can potentially develop in some people including neurological abnormalities or abnormalities affecting the eyes or teeth. Parry-Romberg syndrome usually becomes apparent during the first decade of life or early during the second decade but does occur in adulthood. The majority of individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome experience symptoms before the age of 20 years. The exact cause of Parry-Romberg syndrome is unknown and appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder. The true incidence is unknown. Because the disorder often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed determining the true frequency of Parry-Romberg syndrome in the general population is difficult. Physicians studying the disorder have estimated that Parry-Romberg may affect as many as 1 in 250,000 people in the general population.  Parry-Romberg syndrome appears to affect women slightly more often than men but proper studies of the population are lacking. Parry-Romberg syndrome typically becomes apparent during the first or early during the second decade of life, with the majority of affected individuals experiencing symptoms before the age of 20 years. However, the disorder has been described in infants and individuals more than 50 years of age. Parry-Romberg syndrome was originally described in the medical literature in 1825 (C.H. Parry) and 1846 (E. Henoch and H.M. Romberg). There are anecdotal reports of Parry-Romberg syndrome worsening in some pregnant women, either during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. A diagnosis of Parry-Romberg syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. The specific tests that are used depend on which symptoms are present and which symptoms occur first. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in individuals with neurological symptoms. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues. Surgical removal and microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue may be used in individuals with linear scleroderma en coup sabre.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 20\tToxic Shock Syndrome\nT2\tDISEASE 31 50\tmultisystem disease\nT3\tANAPHOR 82 84\tIt\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 192 212\tToxic Shock Syndrome\nT5\tSIGN 234 244\thigh fever\nT6\tSYMPTOM 246 252\tnausea\nT7\tSIGN 254 262\tvomiting\nT8\tSIGN 264 272\tdiarrhea\nT9\tSIGN 305 316\thypotension\nT10\tSIGN 340 349\tskin rash\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 393 413\tToxic Shock Syndrome\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 608 628\tToxic Shock Syndrome\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 630 633\tTSS\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 721 724\tTSS\nT15\tSIGN 946 951\tfever\nT16\tSIGN 953 957\trash\nT17\tSIGN 994 1006\tdesquamation\nT18\tSIGN 1066 1077\thypotension\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 1335 1363\tRocky Mountain Spotted Fever\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 1365 1378\tLeptospirosis\nT21\tDISEASE 1384 1391\tMeasles\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T4 Arg2:T100\t\nR9\tIs_acron Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\n'}, {'text': 'Kugelberg Welander syndrome is a milder type of spinal muscular atrophy.

Glucose and galactose have very similar chemical structures, and normally the same transport enzyme provides them with entry into specialized cells in the small intestine where they are absorbed and transferred to other cells. As a result of a mutation on chromosome 22, the transport enzyme does not function properly and the result is glucose-galactose malabsorption. Glucose-galactose malabsorption is an extremely rare disorder.  It’s been estimated that there are approximately 200 cases worldwide. Two-thirds of those affected are females. One report suggests that about half of the cases of severe GGM reported have occurred among families that have experienced intermarriage (consanguinity).

The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression located in the bone at the base of skull (sphenoid bone), in which resides the pituitary gland. In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid and a very small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella (partially empty sella) or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland (completely empty sella). Most individuals with empty sella syndrome do not have any associated symptoms, but the finding raises concerns about hormone deficiencies. Empty sella syndrome may occur as a primary disorder, for which the cause is unknown (idiopathic), or as a secondary disorder, in which it occurs due to an underlying condition or disorder such as a treated pituitary tumor, head trauma, or a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also called pseudotumor cerebri) during which elevated intracranial pressure causes empty sella syndrome. Primary empty sella syndrome affects approximately 4 times more women than men. Most cases occur in middle-aged women who are obese and have high blood pressure (hypertension). Because most people with empty sella syndrome do not have symptoms and may go undiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. Some researchers have estimated that less than 1 percent of individuals with empty sella syndrome ultimately develop symptoms associated with the disorder, although this may be higher in men compared to women. A diagnosis of empty sella syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized imaging techniques. Imaging may include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures.

Patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. Jejunal Atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  Human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the  same for each pregnancy.

Individuals with a normal chromosomal make-up have two 22nd chromosomes, both of which have a short arm, known as 22p, and a long arm, known as 22q. However, in individuals with CES, the short arm and a small region of the long arm of chromosome 22 (i.e., 22pter-22q11) are present four times (partial tetrasomy) rather than twice in cells of the body. In a small number of people with CES, the 22q11 region is present in 3 copies (partial trisomy).  The name “cat eye syndrome” is derived from a distinctive eye (ocular) abnormality that is present in a little over half affected individuals. This defect, known as a coloboma, usually appears as a cleft or gap in the iris below the pupil, and the elongated pupil therefore resembles the appearance of a cat’s eye. There are, however, many other features associated with CES involving many organs and systems. These symptoms result from abnormal development during embryo and fetal stages. Associated symptoms vary greatly in presence and severity from one person to another, including among members of the same family. CES may be best thought of as a disorder spectrum. While some people may have few or mild manifestations, others may have multiple severe malformations. CES has been recognized for more than a century. More than 100 cases have been described in the medical literature, including apparently sporadic and familial cases. Many more affected individuals exist but have not been described in the medical literature. However, the syndrome is very rare, and currently there are no accurate estimates of the incidence of CES in the population. Schinzel et al (1981) estimated an incidence of approximately one in 50,000 to one in 150,000 individuals in Northeastern Switzerland. Because some affected individuals develop few associated features, however, the disorder may in some people remain unrecognized.

In the lesion there is no capillary bed, which is part of normal tissue. Brain AVMs are often presumed to be congenital, but there is no direct evidence that they form in utero. The distribution of age at detection for brain AVMs is normally-distributed with the mean age in the mid-30’s. Although a small number of AVMs manifest themselves at or shortly after birth, most of them present later in life, and just as likely, form and progress during the later years of life. The lack of capillaries allows blood traveling through the abnormal fistulous connections to flow rapidly. The low resistance of the direct A-V connections, termed fistulas, results in very high flow rates in the vessels leading to and within the AVM. These high flow rates can lower the pressure in the arteries leading to the AVM and to surrounding relatively normal brain tissue. Further, because of the direct A-V connections, the pressure in the arteries, even if somewhat reduced, are transmitted to the veins draining the AVM and surrounding brain, which normally operate at very low pressures. AVM can occur in many different parts of the body, but those located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) can cause problems that affect the brain like other forms of stroke. AVM are often attributed to result from an error in embryonic or fetal development, but there is no direct evidence of this assertion. No environmental risk factors have been identified for neurological AVM. AVM does not usually run in families, but somewhere on the order of 5% of AVMs may be due to autosomal dominant inheritance of a genetic mutation, most commonly hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or the capillary malformation-AVM syndrome. AVM can rarely be associated with certain syndromes such as Wyburn-Mason syndrome. AVM affects males and females in equal numbers. There does not appear to be an increased risk for particular ethnic and racial groups. The best estimates for new detection of an AVM are 1 per 100,000 population per year (about 3000 new cases detected per year in the U.S.) The population prevalence is about 10 per 100,000, i.e., there are probably about 30,000 individuals in the U.S. who harbor an AVM or have had an AVM that was treated.

In some cases mental retardation may result, but intelligence may be only mildly impaired and subtle psychosocial symptoms may be present. Agenesis of Corpus Callosum produces symptoms during the first two years of life in approximately ninety percent of those affected. It has been thought to be a very rare condition but the increased use of neuro-imaging techniques, such as MRI, is resulting in an increased rate of diagnosis.  This condition may also be identified during pregnancy through an ultrasound.  Currently, the highest estimate of incidence is 7 in 1000 individuals. Agenesis of corpus callosum can occur in conjunction with spina bifida. Spina bifida is a term meaning open (or non-fused) spine.  In spina bifida, one or more of the individual bones of the spine fails to close completely, leaving a cleft or defect in the spinal canal. Part of the contents of the spine can protrude or herniate through this abnormal opening that produces a meningocele or meningomyelocele. (For more information on this disorder, choose “spina bifida” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are imaging techniques that aid in diagnosis of agenesis of corpus callosum.', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 20\tEmpty sella syndrome\nT2\tSIGN 126 139;57 87\tsella turcica enlargement or malformation of\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 288 308\tempty sella syndrome\nT4\tSIGN 314 379\tsella turcica is either partially filled with cerebrospinal fluid\nT5\tSIGN 386 455\tvery small associated pituitary gland lying in the floor of the sella\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 457 478\tpartially empty sella\nT7\tSIGN 483 560\tcompletely filled with cerebrospinal fluid with no visualized pituitary gland\nT8\tRAREDISEASE 562 584\tcompletely empty sella\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 609 629\tempty sella syndrome\nT10\tSIGN 705 725\thormone deficiencies\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 727 747\tEmpty sella syndrome\nT12\tANAPHOR 863 865\tit\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 934 949\tpituitary tumor\nT14\tRAREDISEASE 988 1024\tidiopathic intracranial hypertension\nT15\tRAREDISEASE 1038 1057\tpseudotumor cerebri\nT16\tSIGN 1072 1093\televated intracranial\nT17\tRAREDISEASE 1110 1130\tempty sella syndrome\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 1132 1160\tPrimary empty sella syndrome\nT19\tDISEASE 1294 1306\thypertension\nT20\tSIGN 1294 1306\thypertension\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 1334 1354\tempty sella syndrome\nT22\tANAPHOR 1412 1424\tthe disorder\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 1559 1579\tempty sella syndrome\nT24\tANAPHOR 1624 1636\tthe disorder\nT25\tRAREDISEASE 1707 1727\tempty sella syndrome\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T8 Arg2:T70\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tIs_synon Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tAnaphora Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\nR13\tAnaphora Arg1:T23 Arg2:T24\t\n'}, {'text': 'Congenital heart block is characterized by interference with the transfer of the electrical nerve impulses (conduction) that regulate the normal, rhythmic, pumping action of the heart muscle (heart block).

Symptoms include increased muscle tone with exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), seizures, and loss of cognitive ability (dementia). Alpers disease usually begins during early childhood, usually indicated by seizures at any age between 3 months and 5 years.  It is characterized by lack of coordination of motor movement, partial paralysis, seizures, and muscle twitching. The child is unable to achieve normal muscle tone (hypotonia), yet the limbs appear to be stiff. On MRI examination an increased density of the grey matter in the brain is noted. Usually, but not always, Alpers disease is associated with liver damage.  Mental retardation may be severe and is progressive.  The loss of intellectual functions such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning may also interfere with a person’s daily functioning (dementia).   In later stages, patients may lose control of the movement of their arms and legs (spastic quadriplegia). The liver may become cirrhotic and fail completely, or may not progress beyond signs of jaundice. Affected individuals may also become blind as a result of optic atrophy as the optic nerve degenerates. It is thought that Alpers disease affects males and females in equal numbers usually during early childhood.

It is rare and clinical experience with this condition is limited. Most cases are diagnosed before 8 years of age. It is characterized by an abnormal growth of cartilage arising from the cartilage of the terminal ends (epiphysis) of the long bones, particularly of the lower limbs. The bones of the knee and ankle joints are most commonly affected, as well as part of the foot (tarsal bones). The upper limbs and spine are rarely involved. The abnormal cartilage produces an irregular nodular mass located either in the medial or lateral part of the bone (hemimelic), usually medial. DEH may affect a single bone (localized form), multiple bones in a single limb (classical form) or an entire limb (generalized) usually involving a leg from the pelvis to the foot. Approximately two-thirds of affected children have multiple lesions. DEH was first described in the medical literature in 1926. Trevor recognized this condition in 1950. The name, dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica first appeared in the medical literature in 1956. The cause of DEH is unknown. There is no evidence that hereditary factors play a role in the development of this disease. More research is necessary to determine the exact underlying cause(s) of this disorder.

The symptoms of carnosinemia include extreme drowsiness and seizures that can occur in children under the age of one year. Slow growth, low muscle tone, motor delays, and delayed intellectual development also occur in children with this disorder. Seizures may be accompanied by myoclonic seizures. By approximately 2 years of age, affected children show variable degrees of intellectual deficit leading to intellectual disabilities and developmental regression. Some affected children also have muscle weakness (congenital myopathy). Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that detects electrical activity in the brain, may be abnormal.  A few patients reported with this condition have few or no symptoms. Carnosinemia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 30 individuals with carnosinemia have been reported in the medical literature world-wide. The diagnosis of carnosinemia may be made by testing the levels of amino acids in blood and/or urine, which reveals abnormally high levels of carnosine and anserine in the serum and urine. Very specialized testing of the blood will detect very low activity of the enzyme carnosinase in the blood.

Consider, for example, dense deposit disease (DDD), a very rare kidney disease characterized on a renal biopsy test called ‘immunofluorescence’ by an abundance of a protein called C3 in the renal glomeruli, and named for the extremely dense ‘sausage-like’ deposits that are seen in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) using electron microscopy. In 2013, as a result of a consensus meeting, scientists recommended that DDD be sub-grouped under a new heading – C3 Glomerulopathy, abbreviated C3G. The adoption of this new term was driven by the recognition that there is another group of patients with glomerular disease whose kidney biopsy is reminiscent of DDD. On electron microscopy, the deposits in these patients are lighter in color and more widespread in location, but on immunofluorescence, as with DDD there is an abundance of C3 in the renal glomeruli. These patients are said to have C3 glomerulonephritis or C3GN.  In recognition of shared similarities, both DDD and C3GN are now classified as sub-types of C3G. C3G affects persons of all ages, although the mean age appears to be lower in DDD patients as compared to C3GN patients. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at 2-3 per 1,000,000 people.

Additional characteristic facial abnormalities may include thin, downturned lips; low-set ears; arched, well-defined eyebrows that grow together across the base of the nose (synophrys); an unusually low hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck; and curly, unusually long eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have distinctive malformations of the limbs, such as unusually small hands and feet, inward deviation (clinodactyly) of the fifth fingers, and webbing (syndactyly) of certain toes. Less commonly, there may be absence of the forearms, hands, and fingers. Infants with CdLS may also have feeding and breathing difficulties; an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; a low-pitched "growling" cry and low voice; heart defects; delayed skeletal maturation; hearing loss; or other physical abnormalities.

As these cells accumulate in the body, excessive quantities of an antibody protein known as IgM are produced. Large amounts of IgM cause the blood to become thick (hyperviscosity) and affects the flow of blood through the smaller blood vessels, leading to some of the symptoms of the disorder. Small blood vessels may tear leading to bleeding in the nose, gums, or retina. Symptoms of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia usually begin gradually. Common symptoms are fatigue and loss of energy due to anemia. Bleeding from the nose and gums may also occur, and tingling in the fingers and toes is often seen (peripheral neuropathy). Examination may also reveal enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Blurring or vision impairment may also occur due to changes in blood flow through the blood vessels that serve the retina. The symptoms are quite variable depending on the effect of the thickened (viscous) blood on the organ involved. The causes of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia are unknown. There is evidence of occurrence within families, but such occurrence is uncommon. Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is a very rare disorder affecting about 1 in 3.4 million American men and about half that number of American women. The incidence of WMG is estimated to be about 5 per 1,000,000 people over the age of 50. The median age at diagnosis is 67. However, cases have been diagnosed in patients in their twenties. This disorder is considerably less common among people of African descent. When patients show symptoms of an enlarged spleen and liver combined with bleeding of the retina, WMG is reasonably suspected. The results of a complete blood count (CBC) usually show low red blood cell counts as well as low platelet counts. In such circumstances, electrophoresis (subjecting blood plasma to an electric impulse) of serum samples will show a peak reading for IgM.", 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 26\tCornelia de Lange syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 28 33\tCdLS)\nT3\tDISEASE 44 60\tgenetic disorder\nT4\tSIGN 207 215;230 248\tprenatal growth retardation\nT5\tSIGN 220 248\tpostnatal growth retardation\nT6\tSIGN 266 322\tabnormalities of the head and facial (craniofacial) area\nT7\tSIGN 339 368\tdistinctive facial appearance\nT8\tSIGN 370 390;407 418\tmalformations of the upper limbs\nT9\tDISEASE 440 463\tintellectual disability\nT10\tSIGN 440 463\tintellectual disability\nT11\tANAPHOR 496 508\tthe disorder\nT12\tSIGN 546 564\tmicrobrachycephaly\nT13\tSIGN 569 587;627 635\tprominent vertical philtrum\nT14\tSIGN 640 662\tdepressed nasal bridge\nT15\tSIGN 683 699\tanteverted nares\nT16\tSIGN 730 751\tmaxillary prognathism\nT17\tSIGN 770 782\tmicrognathia\nT18\tSIGN 796 831\tcharacteristic facial abnormalities\nT19\tSIGN 844 865\tthin, downturned lips\nT20\tSIGN 867 879\tlow-set ears\nT21\tSIGN 959 968\tsynophrys\nT22\tSIGN 984 1037\tlow hairline on the forehead and the back of the neck\nT23\tSIGN 1043 1074\tcurly, unusually long eyelashes\nT24\tSIGN 1123 1149\tmalformations of the limbs\nT25\tSIGN 1169 1180\tsmall hands\nT26\tSIGN 1169 1174;1185 1189\tsmall feet\nT27\tSIGN 1209 1221\tclinodactyly\nT28\tDISEASE 1258 1268\tsyndactyly\nT29\tSIGN 1258 1268\tsyndactyly\nT30\tSIGN 1315 1358\tabsence of the forearms, hands, and fingers\nT31\tRAREDISEASE 1373 1377\tCdLS\nT32\tSIGN 1392 1399;1414 1426\tfeeding difficulties\nT33\tSIGN 1404 1426\tbreathing difficulties\nT34\tDISEASE 1459 1480\trespiratory infection\nT35\tSIGN 1485 1525\t"low-pitched ""growling"" cry and low voice"\nT36\tSIGN 1527 1540\theart defects\nT37\tSIGN 1542 1569\tdelayed skeletal maturation\nT38\tSIGN 1571 1583\thearing loss\nT39\tSIGN 1594 1616\tphysical abnormalities\nT40\tRAREDISEASE 1726 1730\tCdLS\nT41\tRAREDISEASE 1880 1884\tCdLS\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T70\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T160\t\nR15\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T17\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T18\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T19\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T20\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T21\t\nR20\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T22\t\nR21\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T23\t\nR22\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T24\t\nR23\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T25\t\nR24\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T26\t\nR25\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T270\t\nR26\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T29\t\nR27\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T30\t\nR28\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T32\t\nR29\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T33\t\nR30\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T31 Arg2:T34\t\nR31\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T35\t\nR32\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T36\t\nR33\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T37\t\nR34\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T380\t\nR35\tProduces Arg1:T31 Arg2:T39\t\n'}, {'text': 'Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormal ears associated with hearing impairment and thumb malformations. Abnormalities in the feet, heart and kidneys also occur frequently. Townes-Brocks syndrome is associated with a mutation in the SALL1 gene. The absence of the anal opening (imperforate anus) is the most common feature of TBS.   Small ears and a folded rim of skin and cartilage around the outer ear are usually present.  Congenital sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss can range from mild to severe and can be progressive.   The most common thumb malformations are three bones instead of two (triphalangeal thumbs) and duplicated thumbs (preaxial polydactyly).  Feet anomalies occur less frequently and include a short third toe, overlapping toes and flat feet.  Kidney dysfunction can occur with or without kidney malformations.   Typical kidney anomalies include displaced or rotated kidneys, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, and underdeveloped kidneys.  Abnormalities of the heart, eye and spine are infrequently associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  Mental retardation occurs in approximately 10% of affected individuals. Townes-Brocks syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.  Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the appearance of the disease.  The SALL1 gene is the only gene known to be associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome.  The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent, or can be the result of a new mutation (gene change) in the affected individual.  Approximately 50% of affected individuals have the condition as a result of a new mutation.  The risk of passing the abnormal gene from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child. The prevalence of Townes-Brock syndrome is not known but has been estimated to be at least 1 in 250,000 births.  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers.

TTD has been reported in all ethnic groups. An initial evaluation for TTD involves a diagnostic work-up, including obtaining a detailed history of the patient’s prenatal and neonatal history. A detailed physical exam is performed to assess clinical features such as hair abnormalities, short stature, small chin, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment or developmental delay, and bone and teeth anomalies. Evaluation by a developmental pediatrician or neurologist may determine whether there is any developmental delay or intellectual impairment. MRI imaging of the brain to identify abnormal patterns of myelination is often performed. Laboratory testing for immune function, blood count and iron levels can also be performed. TTD is typically diagnosed by polarized light microscopy of hair shafts, revealing a tiger-tail pattern, and at times by measurement of reduced sulfur content in patient’s hair. The classical tiger-tail pattern alone usually is enough to diagnose TTD. However, there are other conditions with similar hair shaft abnormalities and often genetic testing is ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

The symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy are slowly progressive during infancy and childhood. However, this disorder is not progressive in adulthood. The first symptoms of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy in a newborn are the slow, progressive loss of muscle tone characterized by floppiness (hypotonia) and general weakness.  Early motor skills and other important developmental milestones may be slightly delayed.  Toddlers with this disorder usually have mild muscle weakness and may be prone to falling or stumbling.  The muscles of the pelvis, neck, and shoulder area are most commonly affected.  Since the symptoms of this disease are not progressive during adulthood, most people with Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy walk normally as adults.  However, some physical activities may be slightly impaired. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent. Fifty percent of their children risk being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  The symptoms of this disorder are most obvious during infancy and childhood.  Nine cases of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy have been described in the medical literature.  Six of these cases were reported in one family.

The two lower chambers are known as ventricles and are separated from each other by the ventricular septum. Valves connect the atria (left and right) to their respective ventricles. The valves allow for blood to be pumped through the chambers. Blood travels from the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The blood returns to the heart through pulmonary veins and enters the left ventricle. The left ventricle sends the now oxygen-filled blood into the main artery of the body (aorta). The aorta sends the blood throughout the body. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males (67 percent) more often than females. The estimated prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 100,000 live births. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 7-9 percent of all congenital heart defects. The symptoms of this disorder are present at birth (congenital). The diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests.

The enzyme defect leads to the abnormal accumulation of certain complex compounds (glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides), which have terminal or preterminal N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in many tissues of the body and in urine. Two major forms of Schindler disease exist - a severe form with onset in infancy (type I) and a milder form with onset in adulthood (type II). Some researchers have proposed a type III form of Schindler disease that is less severe than type I, but more severe than type II. The specific symptoms and severity of Schindler disease can vary from one person to another. Schindler disease is caused by mutations of the NAGA gene and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Schindler disease affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of Schindler disease in the general population is unknown. Because cases of Schindler disease may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining the disorder’s true frequency in the general population is difficult. As a group, lysosomal storage diseases are infrequent, although certain disorders may occur in specific ethnic or demographic groups at higher frequencies, about one in every 1,000-2,000 live births for Gaucher and Fabry diseases, or very infrequently (1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births) for most of these disorders, which may be the case for alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency.

When anesthetic drugs such as succinylcholine or mivacurium are administered to a susceptible person, the muscles that work the lungs may become paralyzed. Mechanical ventilation is essential until the excess anesthetic agent is metabolized and normal breathing is resumed. Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency have a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in their blood serum.  If the drug succinylcholine (or another anesthetic derivative of choline) is given during surgery, the respiratory muscles become paralyzed and the patient stops breathing (apnea).  Artificial respiration (mechanical ventilation) may be necessary until the drug is eliminated from the body and the affected individual is able to resume breathing.  If the person with pseudocholinesterase deficiency is not exposed to a choline-derived anesthetic, he or she may never be aware of having a deficiency of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is present at birth and occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1,500 to 2,500 people in the United States.  Among Caucasian Americans, it seems to affect males almost twice as often as females. Apnea is the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep.  Infantile apnea refers to pauses in breathing during an infant’s sleep.  Apnea is called central apnea or diaphragmatic apnea when there are no chest movements during the pauses in breathing.  When there are chest movements but no passage of air through the mouth or nostrils, the disorder is known as obstructive apnea or upper airway apnea.  Central apnea followed by or intermixed with an obstructive apnea is called mixed apnea.

The specific symptoms and severity of Alagille syndrome can vary greatly from one person to another, even within the same family. Some individuals may have mild forms of the disorder while others may have more serious forms. Common symptoms, which often develop during the first three months of life, include blockage of the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis), yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes (jaundice), poor weight gain and growth, severe itching (pruritis) and pale, loose stools. Additional symptoms include heart murmurs, congenital heart defects, vertebral (back bone) differences, thickening of the ring that normally lines the cornea in the eye (posterior embryotoxon) and distinctive facial features. Most people with Alagille syndrome have mutations in one copy of the JAG1 gene. A small percentage (less than 1 percent) of patients have mutations of the NOTCH2 gene. These mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, however in about half of cases the mutation occurs as a new change ("de novo") in the individual and was not inherited from a parent.

The symptoms of this disorder are similar, but less severe than those of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis type II) and may include progressive joint stiffness, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and/or skeletal deformities of the hands (e.g., claw-hands). Growth delays accompanied by deterioration of the hip joints typically develop in children with pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy. Additional symptoms may include clouding of the corneas of the eyes, mild to moderate coarseness of facial features, mild mental retardation, easy fatigability, and/or heart disease. Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A diagnosis of pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy may be suspected based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic findings.

The symptoms of Infectious arthritis depend upon which agent has caused the infection but symptoms often include fever, chills, general weakness, and headaches, followed by inflammation and painful swelling of one or more joints of the body. Any disease-causing microbe may infect a joint.  Bacteria are most often responsible, typically producing an acute arthritic attack.  In young children the most common bacteria are staphylococci, haemophilus influenzae, and gram- negative bacilli.  Older children and adults are most commonly infected with gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci or pneumococci.  Acute infectious arthritis at any age may be associated with rubella, mumps or hepatitis B infections.  Fungi and fungi-like bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc may cause chronic infectious arthritis.  People with rheumatoid arthritis and chronically inflamed joints are particularly susceptible to infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis can affect people of all ages and both sexes.  About half of all cases involve adults over the age of 60.  The incidence is reported as 2-10 cases per 100,000 of general population.  For patients with immunologic disorders, the incidence increases to about 30-70 cases per 100,000 people.  In gonococcal arthritis, the disorder is found in three times as many women as men. A thorough history and physical examination are essential for diagnosis. Blood tests as well as tests of the fluid commonly found in the joints are essential for identification of the infecting agent and to confirm diagnosis.

Banti syndrome may occur due to a number of different factors causing obstruction of, and abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension) within, certain veins of the spleen (splenic veins) or the liver (e.g., hepatic or portal veins).  These may include abnormalities present at birth (congenital) of such veins, blood clots, or various underlying disorders causing inflammation and obstruction of veins (vascular obstruction) of the liver, such as cirrhosis.  Increased arsenic intake has also been implicated in some cases.  Also, cases have occurred in patients taking long-term azathioprine, particularly after kidney transplantation. Banti syndrome affects males and females equally.  It is relatively common in parts of India and Japan, but rare in Western countries.

People who have Mikulicz syndrome are at heightened risk for developing lymphomas. Mikulicz syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of extreme dryness in the mouth (xerostomia) that may lead to difficulty swallowing and tooth decay.  Other symptoms include enlarged tear glands (lacrimal glands), leading to absent or decreased tears; enlarged glands in the neck (parotid glands); hard, painless swellings (tumefactions) of the saliva glands (salivary glands) of the mouth and those near the ears (parotid).   Glands near the jaw (submaxillary) may also become swollen.  Symptoms may persist for long periods of time or come and go with frequent recurrences. The symptoms of Mikulicz syndrome are very similar to those of Sjögren syndrome and some researchers suspect that they may be the same disorder (see Related Disorders section of this report).", 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 13 15\tEI\nT2\tSIGN 33 65\tred, blistering and denuded skin\nT3\tSIGN 88 103\tskin thickening\nT4\tSIGN 147 157\tblistering\nT5\tSIGN 198 205\tscaling\nT6\tSIGN 210 225\tskin thickening\nT7\tSIGN 227 233\tScales\nT8\tSIGN 287 311\tgeneralized erythroderma\nT9\tDISEASE 299 311\terythroderma\nT10\tDISEASE 370 385\tSkin infections\nT11\tSYMPTOM 425 441\tHeat intolerance\nT12\tSIGN 455 479\tpalmoplantar keratoderma\nT13\tSKINRAREDISEASE 455 479\tpalmoplantar keratoderma\nT14\tSIGN 522 538\tlimit ambulation\nT15\tSIGN 522 527;543 556\tlimit hand function\nT16\tSIGN 677 687\tblistering\nT17\tSIGN 733 757\tpalmoplantar keratoderma\nT18\tSKINRAREDISEASE 733 757\tpalmoplantar keratoderma\nT19\tSIGN 790 822\tbrown-grey hyperkeratotic spines\nT20\tSKINRAREDISEASE 839 857\tichthyosis hystrix\nT21\tSKINRAREDISEASE 859 872\tCurth-Macklin\nT22\tSKINRAREDISEASE 875 877\tEI\nT23\tANAPHOR 928 930\tIt\nT24\tSKINRAREDISEASE 975 977\tEI\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T50\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T70\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR14\tIs_a Arg1:T20 Arg2:T22\t\nR15\tIs_synon Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T16\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T17\t\nR18\tAnaphora Arg1:T22 Arg2:T23\t\n'}, {'text': 'Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a term used to describe a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes or RBCs).

However, in individuals with XLP, exposure to EBV may result in severe, life-threatening fulminant hepatitis; abnormally low levels of antibodies in the blood and body secretions (hypogammaglobulinemia), resulting in increased susceptibility to various infections; malignancies of certain types of lymphoid tissue (B-cell lymphomas); and/or other abnormalities. The range of symptoms and findings associated with XLP may vary considerably from case to case. In addition, the range of effects may change in an affected individual over time. In most cases, individuals with XLP experience an onset of symptoms anytime from ages about 6 months to 10 years of age. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that is usually fully expressed in males only.

In 1998, the National Syphilis Elimination Plan went into effect. One of the goals of this plan was to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis (CS) to fewer than 40 cases per 100,000 live births. The incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns under a year old rose in the United States from 180 cases in 1957 to 422 cases in 1972.

Infants develop reddened plaques of thickened, rough and/or scaly skin, especially on the face, buttocks, arms and legs. Over time, these lesions can cover large areas of the body. The distribution of these lesions is almost perfectly symmetrical, meaning the size, shape and location of the lesions are extremely similar on both sides of the body. These plaques are slowly progressive increasing in number and size throughout early childhood before either stabilizing or disappearing sometime later during life. Rarely, waxing and waning may occur. In some cases, the chest and abdomen may become involved. Abnormally thickened or calloused skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar keratoderma) is not uncommon. PSEK affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is unknown. The disorder was first described by Darier in 1911.

This phenomenon is only associated  with two rare vascular tumors: kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas.  This condition can be life threatening secondary to the risk of bleeding and progression to DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Initially a vascular lesion is noted on the skin which can be firm, indurated and purpuric.  Areas of petechiae (tiny red dots) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body.  If the vascular lesion is internal, these petechiae can be seen on the skin.  Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur.  These tumors are not hemangiomas.  They usually present in young infants, less than three months of age, but have rarely been reported in older children.  These tumors occur in the extremities, chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis.  They infiltrate across tissue plans and can be aggravated by interventions, infection and trauma.  When these tumors with KMP are internal such as in the pleural or retroperitoneum, they can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  The morbidity and mortality is caused by bleeding. The cause of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is unknown. It is believed to be secondary to sequestration or trapping of platelets into the tumor.  These tumors are made up of abnormal endothelial cells (spindle cells) and also lymphatic malformation.  It is unclear why the KMP occurs and if it is caused by the spindle cells or the lymphatic component. Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare disorder that affects males and females equally The diagnosis is most often made during infancy but older children have been reported with this phenomenon.  KHE and TA tumors can occur without KMP.  The reason for this is still unknown and may be secondary to a smaller size of the tumor, an older age at presentation or other clinical features. The diagnosis of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is based on the diagnosis of Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma/tufted angioma and this coagulopathy as noted above.  If this diagnosis is suspected blood work including a CBC with differential and platelets, fibrinogen, D-dimer, PT, and PTT should be ordered. The best imaging modality to assess the extent of the lesion is a MRI with contrast.

Such extensive bleeding may reduce the blood flow to the pituitary gland causing the pituitary cells to be damaged or die (necrosis). Thus, the production of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced, perhaps by a significant amount. During pregnancy the pituitary gland will enlarge and may double in size. At this time the gland is especially vulnerable to a severe drop in blood pressure (sometimes called "shock") and excessive maternal bleeding may induce the "shock" and the damage to the cells of the gland. At that time the amount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased giving rise to the symptoms associated with hypopituitarism. There appear to be two forms of the disorder; a chronic form and an acute form, depending on the amount of damage to the gland\'s cells. The acute form reflects considerable damage so that symptoms become apparent soon after delivery. In chronic cases, the volume of damage is much less and symptoms may not appear for months or years after delivery. Sheehan syndrome affects women with excessive blood loss and circulatory collapse following childbirth. The incidence of Sheehan syndrome is not known. In patients with severe hemorrhaging on delivery accompanied by long-lasting low blood pressure, treatment is started as soon as possible.

It is a type of tumor that affects the bones. Osteosarcoma can affect people at any age, but is most common during the teen-aged years, and is the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents under the age of 20. The long bones of the legs, usually near where they connect to the knees, and the upper long bone of the arms, near where this bone meets the shoulders are the most common sites for osteosarcoma formation. Symptoms will vary depending upon the exact location and extent of disease. Pain is the most common symptom of osteosarcoma and there is often a mass or bump that can be felt (palpable). Eighty percent of individuals present with localized disease, which means the cancer remains in the area it first developed. Osteosarcoma can spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, most likely the lungs. The exact cause is unknown in most individuals, but osteosarcoma can be induced by radiation. Most individuals are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, radiation therapy may be used. There are estimated to be about 750-1,000 new individuals diagnosed with osteosarcoma each year in the United States. About 450 of those are children or adolescents under the age of 20. Osteosarcoma is a rare disorder, but it is the most common cause of bone cancer in children and adolescents.

Early in the course of the disease there are usually no symptoms (asymptomatic). As the disease progresses, symptoms like indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and feeling full earlier than normal (early satiety) may develop. The cause of stomach cancer is multifactorial, which means that multiple factors that occur together are necessary for the cancer to develop. These factors can include genetic, immunologic, infectious, and environmental factors. Stomach cancer usually develops randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically), and there is usually no family history. There are about 28,000 people diagnosed with stomach cancer in the United States each year. It affects men more often than it does women, and about 75% of people are over the age of 50. Most people are diagnosed between 60-80 years of age. By some estimates, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide.

Subtypes of acquired lipodystrophy include acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and high active antiretroviral induced lipodystrophy, which may develop in HIV-infected individuals undergoing a specific form of treatment. Onset of acquired forms of lipodystrophy can occur during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Affected individuals develop characteristic loss of body fat (adipose tissue) affecting specific areas of the body, especially the arms, legs, face, neck, and chest or thoracic regions. In some cases, metabolic complications associated with insulin resistance can develop. Such complications include an inability to break down glucose (glucose intolerance), elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia), and diabetes. Additional symptoms such as fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver or hepatic steatosis) may also occur.

For example, many affected infants have semisolid or fluid-filled swellings (cysts) within the cavities of the skull (orbits) that accommodate the eyeballs and associated structures. In most patients, the eye on the affected side or sides is also abnormally small (microphthalmos). Brain abnormalities associated with OCC syndrome may include enlargement of the ventricular system, multiple fluid-filled spaces within and malformations of the outer region of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex), absence of the band of nerve fibers that joins the brain's hemispheres (agenesis of the corpus callosum), and a typical malformation of mid- and hindbrain. Affected infants and children often have intellectual disability and episodes of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (seizures).

A contracture is a condition in which a joint becomes permanently fixed in a bent (flexed) or straightened (extended) position, completely or partially restricting the movement of the affected joint. When congenital contractures occur only in one body area, it is not referred to as arthrogryposis but rather an isolated congenital contracture. The most common form of an isolated congenital contracture is clubfoot. When arthrogryposis affects two or more different areas of the body, it may be referred to as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). The most common form of AMC is amyoplasia. Arthrogryposis and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are sometimes used interchangeably. The number of males and females affected by AMC is approximately equal. The condition has been reported in individuals of Asian, African and European descent. Isolated congenital contractures affect approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population. AMC affects approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. AMC is, by definition, present at birth (congenital). A diagnosis of AMC is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., multiple congenital contractures), a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Certain tests may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of AMC including nerve conduction, electromyography and muscle biopsy, which can help diagnose neuropathic or myopathic disorders. A nerve conduction study measures how rapidly nerves carry an electrical impulse. An electromyography is a test that records electrical activity in skeletal voluntary muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small amount of affected tissue (e.g., muscle) is removed and studied under a microscopic to detect characteristic changes or findings that can aid in obtaining a diagnosis. Imaging studies of the central nervous system (CNS) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, microarray, and exome studies may also be useful studies in making diagnoses. Because of the many mutations that can lead to arthrogryposis, whole genome sequencing is often required (preferable in both parents for comparison as well) to make a diagnosis.', 'annotations': 'T1\tSIGN 27 108\texcessive oral tendencies with an urge to put all kinds of objects into the mouth\nT2\tSIGN 110 129\thypermetamorophosis\nT3\tSIGN 162 173\tmemory loss\nT4\tSIGN 175 192\temotional changes\nT5\tSIGN 194 217\textreme sexual behavior\nT6\tSIGN 219 231\tindifference\nT7\tSIGN 233 242\tplacidity\nT8\tSIGN 244 266\tvisual distractibility\nT9\tDISEASE 271 285\tvisual agnosia\nT10\tSIGN 271 285\tvisual agnosia\nT11\tDISEASE 457 465\tdementia\nT12\tSIGN 457 465\tdementia\nT13\tRAREDISEASE 492 512\tKlüver-Bucy syndrome\nT14\tSIGN 530 571\tdamage to the temporal lobes of the brain\nT15\tDISEASE 650 677\tdegenerative brain diseases\nT16\tDISEASE 679 685\ttumors\nT17\tANAPHOR 690 692\tit\nT18\tDISEASE 715 731\tbrain infections\nT19\tDISEASE 747 761\therpes simplex\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 762 774\tencephalitis\nT21\tDISEASE 778 799\tviral brain infection\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 802 822\tKlüver-Bucy syndrome\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 899 919\tKlüver-Bucy syndrome\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T80\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T140\t\nR12\tAnaphora Arg1:T13 Arg2:T17\t\nR13\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T15 Arg2:T17\t\nR14\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR16\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR17\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T20 Arg2:T17\t\nR18\tIs_a Arg1:T20 Arg2:T21\t\n'}, {'text': 'ADEM can develop at any age, but is much more frequent in children than adults.

However, these abnormalities of the navicular bone are bilateral in approximately 25% of patients and may be seen in children who do not have Kohler disease.', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 12\tMacroglossia\nT2\tSIGN 29 54\tenlargement of the tongue\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 71 83\tmacroglossia\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 168 180\tmacroglossia\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 260 273\tDown syndrome\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 277 304\tBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 410 422\tmacroglossia\nT8\tSIGN 466 473\tstridor\nT9\tSIGN 476 483\tsnoring\nT10\tSIGN 492 512\tfeeding difficulties\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 585 597\tmacroglossia\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 653 665\tMacroglossia\nT13\tANAPHOR 795 807\tthe disorder\nT14\tSIGN 929 953\tlarge size of the tongue\nT15\tSIGN 969 1010\tabnormal development of the jaw and teeth\nT16\tSIGN 1025 1055\tmisaligned or protruding teeth\nT17\tSIGN 1058 1110\tUlceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 1178 1190\tmacroglossia\nT19\tRAREDISEASE 1345 1357\tmacroglossia\nT20\tRAREDISEASE 1386 1398\tmacroglossia\nT21\tRAREDISEASE 1423 1450\tBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\nT22\tANAPHOR 1474 1487\tthat syndrome\nT23\tRAREDISEASE 1542 1582\tisolated autosomal dominant macroglossia\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T140\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T13 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR13\tAnaphora Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\n'}, {'text': 'Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic and sleep related movement disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move in the legs that typically occurs or worsens at rest. It is usually accompanied by abnormal, uncomfortable sensations, known as paresthesias or dysesthesias, that are often likened to crawling, cramping, aching, burning, itching, or prickling deep within the affected areas. Although the legs are usually involved, an urge to move with paresthesias or dysesthesias may also sometimes affect the arms or other areas of the body. Those with RLS may vigorously move the affected area, engage in pacing, or perform other, often repetitive movements, such as stretching, bending, or rocking. Symptoms typically worsen in the evening or at night, often resulting in sleep disturbances. Some individuals with RLS may also develop symptoms during other extended periods of inactivity, such as while sitting in a movie theater or traveling in a car. RLS may occur as a primary condition or due to another underlying disorder, certain medications, or other factors (secondary or symptomatic RLS). In primary RLS, the disorder is often genetic in origin or occurs for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Secondary RLS may occur in association with certain conditions, such as iron deficiency, low levels of the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (anemia), kidney failure, or pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome appears to be about twice as common in women than men. Associated symptoms may become apparent at any age, and the disorder is usually chronic, often becoming more severe with increasing age. However, in some affected individuals, RLS symptoms may periodically subside and recur with varying levels of severity. According to some reports, although most individuals do not bring their symptoms to the attention of physicians until middle age, up to 40 percent may initially experience symptoms before age 20. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is based upon a thorough clinical evaluation; a complete patient history, including current medications; family history; and specialized tests. In addition, a clinical assessment scale may be used to help evaluate severity of the disorder. Various laboratory studies may be conducted to help detect or rule out possible associated conditions, including tests to measure iron and ferritin levels in the blood to assess iron stores in the body. In addition, a neurological examination may be conducted if associated neurological abnormalities are suspected (e.g., peripheral neuropathy). In addition, some physicians may recommend specialized sleep studies to evaluate sleep disturbances and possible PLMS, but sleep studies are not needed to diagnose uncomplicated RLS.', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 17 49\tprogressive osseous heteroplasia\nT2\tDISEASE 179 203\theterotopic ossification\nT3\tSIGN 179 203\theterotopic ossification\nT4\tSKINRAREDISEASE 272 275\tPOH\nT5\tSIGN 394 403;405 464\ttransient increased levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood serum\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tIs_acron Arg1:T4 Arg2:T1\t\n'}, {'text': 'NGLY1 NGLY1 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2012.

Clinically, it can be first noticed particularly in the extremity in an area of recent trauma where the patient may find a mass, however the cause and effect are quite likely purely coincidental. Liposarcoma generally is attributed to a change in some of the genes that are normally present in fat cells.  A series of abnormalities in these genes (mutations or DNA alterations) can lead to malignant changes characterized by uncontrollable growth. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, affecting approximately 2000 individuals each year in the United States. It affects men more than women, and more specifically middle-aged men ranging from 50 – 65 years of age. Children are rarely diagnosed, but when liposarcoma does occur in children, it is usually during adolescence. There is no specific ethnicity in which liposarcoma is more common. Certain risk factors have been shown to predispose individuals to developing soft tissue sarcomas, such as liposarcoma, including: prior radiation, familial cancer syndromes, damage to the lymph system, and long term exposure to certain toxic chemicals such as vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make plastic. There are other diseases that can present very similarly to liposarcoma. Lipoma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumor that can look similar to liposarcoma but it is usually softer and feels like a mass directly below the skin rather than in deeper parts of the body. A lipoma cannot transform into a liposarcoma.

Aquired neuromyotonia is a rare disorder affecting males and females but is slightly more common among men. Disease onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 60 years but has also been reported in childhood.

The structure of the brain on the affected side may be markedly abnormal or show only subtle changes. In either case, as a consequence of this size and structural differences, the enlarged brain tissue causes frequent seizures, often associated with cognitive or behavioral disabilities. Seizures in association with HME often begin in early infant life including an association with infantile spasms. Hemimegalencephaly may occur as an isolated or sporadic brain malformation or it may be associated with other neurodevelopmental syndromes. Thus, when detected, HME should prompt a search for other syndromic diagnoses. Hemimegalencephaly is a very rare disorder for which prevalence estimates are not available. Examination by MRI is usually sufficient to confirm a suspected case of HME. Thus, an MRI examination should be performed as soon as HME is suspected.

Two main theories have been proposed to explain the development of the disorder. One theory attributes the disorder to causes that arise internally within the fetus (intrinsic theory); the other theory attributes the disorder to causes acting upon the fetus externally (extrinsic theory).

Symptoms often become apparent early during infancy or childhood. The disorder is characterized by repeated bacterial infections of the skin and lungs (pneumonia), skeletal abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. The first symptom is often the development of a dry, red flaky skin rash (eczema) at birth or early during infancy. Researchers have discovered that mutations in the STAT3 gene cause AD-HIES in over 60% of the patients. Most cases of AD-HIES occur as the result of a new mutation in this gene.

Mesenteric panniculitis most often appears during the sixth and seventh decade of life, and its incidence appears to increase with age. Children and adolescents are less commonly affected, possibly related to a lesser amount of fat in their mesentery, but more importantly because of specific characteristics of this form of autoimmunity. Symptoms of the mesenteric panniculitis mimic those of a number of other benign and malignant conditions. Because of this, it is important to rule out other diseases prior to confirming the diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis. Infectious causes range from viral, bacterial (including V. cholerae) and parasitic infections. There are also a variety of diseases that are associated with mesenteric abnormalities on abdominal imaging.

When PBC is very severe, it can lead to yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice). If PBC is untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, or scarring of the entire liver, which can lead to liver failure.   PBC is divided into four stages, with stage 1 being early disease, where this is no significant scarring, to stage 4, or which is defined by cirrhosis. Although the exact cause of PBC is unknown, it is thought that it is likely due to a combination of factors such as  autoimmune (when a person’s own immune system attacks their body), genetic, and environmental factors. PBC affects mostly women, but more men are now being diagnosed. The disorder usually becomes apparent during middle age, initially affecting most individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years.

Respiratory control is the automatic function of breathing in response to varied activities of daily living (ex. exercise, sleep, eating), so within the context of the ANS. The ANS is the portion of the nervous system that controls or regulates many involuntary body functions including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature regulation, bowel and bladder control, breathing, and more. The endocrine system is regulated by the hypothalamus, and through hormones it controls growth, energy and water balance, sexual maturation and fertility as well as response to stress. The diagnosis of ROHHAD is currently based on clinical criteria and though investigation of genetic mutations is underway, no specific cause for ROHHAD has been found to date. ROHHAD is a very rare disorder with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature and clinically to date. Though first described under a different name in 1965, it was not re-named until 2007 nor shown to be distinct from CCHS (documented absence of CCHS-related PHOX2B mutations). Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD.  Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features. In CCHS, the hallmark is hypoventilation while sleeping and, in severe cases, hypoventilation while awake and asleep – despite anatomically normal heart, lung, and airways. Both CCHS and ROHHAD fall within the rubric of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA). CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide.  Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) – allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment. CCHS is often diagnosed in the newborn period because of breathing problems, but milder forms of CCHS may go undiagnosed through infancy, childhood, and even adulthood. A simple blood test can be done to look for a PHOX2B gene mutation (PHOX2B is the disease-defining gene for CCHS). Different types of mutations can occur in this gene which will determine how severely an individual with CCHS is affected. Stepwise testing for PHOX2B mutations should be done with close involvement by a physician and genetic counselor.

Gliadin, a component of the wheat storage protein gluten, together with similar proteins in barley and rye, are the villains that trigger the immune reaction in celiac disease. The diagnosis of RCD is made by exclusion, especially of any other disorder that can affect the huge number of thread-like projections that line the interior of the intestine (intestinal villi), such as intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or hypogammaglobulinemia. Refractory celiac disease is rare among adults and is almost never seen in children. Data regarding the true incidence and prevalence of RCD are unreliable, but some have estimated that there might be 20,000 patients in the USA. However, those estimations are based on incomplete data. In one recent study, 1.5% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease at a single US center developed RCD. Of those with RCD 85% had the less severe Type I RCD. Virtually all clinicians studying refractory celiac disease emphasize that the diagnosis is based on eliminating all other possible sources of the symptoms and intestinal injury. One article lists more than 10 conditions that must be considered and eliminated before a convincing diagnosis of refractory celiac disease may be made. As noted above, examination of the interior wall of the intestine (upper and lower) by means of an enteroscope or colonoscope as well as obtaining intestinal biopsies to be examined under a microscope is useful, especially to determine if the symptoms are the result of intestinal disorders other than RCD. Capsule endoscopy, which examines the small intestinal lining using a camera mounted on a swallowed pill, may also be useful in evaluating the degree of small intestinal inflammation and injury.  Some specialized centers are able to offer sophisticated examinations of the biopsy materials that in many cases will assist in the diagnosis. These studies emphasize the presence of abnormal populations of T lymphocytes in the tissue indicating a diagnosis of the more aggressive Type II RCD. Other imaging studies (barium X-ray, CT scan, capsule enteroscopy and MRE) may be undertaken, especially if there is concern for the presence of a lymphoma. Several therapies for RCD have been tried in uncontrolled tests with inconclusive results. Among the therapies tested in this way are: elemental diet (an elemental diet is a liquid diet consisting of nutrients that require no digestion, including amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and triglycerides); and total parental nutrition (TPN) that is defined as nutrition maintained entirely by intravenous injection or by some other nongastrointestinal route. Steroid therapy is a mainstay of treatment but its beneficial effect is short-lived in patients of lymphoma.

The two species of worms most often associated with this disease are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The larval form of the parasite transmits the disease to humans by the bite of a mosquito. In the early stages of the infection, the patient characteristically complains of fever, chills, headaches and skin lesions. Any one of several antiparasitic agents may be effective in eliminating the worm. However, if the disease is left untreated, obstruction of the lymph flow will cause particular areas of the body especially the legs and external genitals, to swell profoundly. Symptoms are primarily a response to adult worms that cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation may progress to hardening of the lymphatic vessels (fibrosis) and obstruction of the lymph flow. Filariasis is a rare infectious tropical disorder caused by the round worm parasites (nematode) Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi.  Symptoms result primarily from inflammatory reactions to the adult worms.  Some people may also develop hypersensitivity reactions to the small larval parasites (microfilariae). Filariasis is common disease in tropical regions of the world.  The organism W. bancrofti is present throughout Africa, Asia, China, and South America. B. malayi is found in southern and southeast Asia.  Filariasis is extremely rare in North America and occurs only when these organisms are imported from tropical regions.  The infection is transmitted by several different types of tropical mosquitos which transfer the larval stage of the organism (microfilariae) from one host to another. Lymphatic filariasis affects about 120 million people worldwide.  Short-term travelers to areas where it is endemic are at low risk for this infection.  People who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time, and especially those who are in areas or situations in which they are intensely exposed to infected mosquitoes, can become infected.  Most infections seen in the U.S. are in immigrants from endemic countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 37\tCongenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 39 42\tCPL\nT3\tDISEASE 54 76\tdevelopmental disorder\nT4\tSIGN 158 165;167 201\tdilated lymphatic vessels within the lungs\nT5\tRAREDISEASE 629 632\tCPL\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 714 717\tCPL\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 796 799\tCPL\nT8\tANAPHOR 825 837\tthe disorder\nT9\tRAREDISEASE 896 899\tCPL\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tIs_acron Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\n'}, {'text': 'Peutz Jeghers syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and can occur in any racial or ethnic group.

The abnormal gene is called DMD and is located on the X chromosome. Becker muscular dystrophy follows x-linked recessive inheritance so it mostly affects males, but some females are affected. Becker muscular dystrophy usually begins in the teens or early twenties and symptoms vary greatly between affected individuals. Muscle deterioration progresses slowly but usually results in the need for a wheel chair. Muscles of the heart deteriorate (cardiomyopathy) in some affected individuals, and this process can become life-threatening. Learning disabilities involving visual abilities may be present. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births. The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy is based on physical symptoms, family history, an elevated concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood indicating destruction of muscle, and molecular genetic testing. DMD is the only gene that has been associated with Becker muscular dystrophy and many different types of DMD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with this condition. Identification of a DMD gene mutation from molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis.

Warts may appear and skin is often oily or greasy. These skin lesions are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths and tend to appear predominately during middle age. Itching, irritation, inflammations or unsightliness of lesions may require surgical removal of affected skin areas. Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratosis are limited to discolored skin lesions that appear to be “stuck on” the skin surface.  These patches may appear suddenly, may vary in size, and tend to grow slowly.  They may be round or oval-shaped, and vary in color from tan, yellowish-brown to black.  They may be widespread over the trunk, back, and/or shoulders.  Some may be large enough to be called “giants” while others may be limited to small areas of the temples or cheeks.  The skin lesions may also be waxy, scaling or crusted.  They tend to become darker and larger with age. The exact cause of Seborrheic Keratosis is not known although researchers believe some forms may be inherited as a dominant trait.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) will be expressed “dominating” the normal gene and resulting in appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50% for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.) Seborrheic Keratosis predominately affects middle aged individuals, although in very rare cases, it can be present at birth. Since Seborrheic Keratosis is not a form of skin cancer, treatment is not essential and removal of lesions is usually performed only to enhance comfort and/or cosmetic appearance. Treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis consists of removal of the skin lesions by scraping (curettage), sealing off blood vessels or destruction of lesions (electrodessication) with local anesthetic, shave excision, or freezing with CO2 snow or liquid nitrogen. Trichloroacetic acid may be used to eliminate lesions. Dermabrasion removal may also be performed.

This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis is the spread and growth of cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. Cancers that are most frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis include the gastrointestinal (colon, rectal, appendiceal, gastric, pancreas, small bowel and gallbladder) and the gynecologic (ovarian, primary peritoneal, and uterine) cancers. Other cancers that can spread to the abdominal cavity include breast, esophagus, and melanoma. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a subtype of sarcoma of the intestine that can also present with multiple cancer tumors in the abdomen. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a cancer that originates in the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) and presents with signs and symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because there are no unique features of appendiceal cancer on imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, PET scan or MRI, the actual diagnosis of appendiceal cancer cannot be made until a tumor specimen is examined by a pathologist. This is frequently accomplished at the time of appendectomy for appendicitis, surgery for an intestinal blockage or presumed ovarian cancer, or through a diagnostic tumor biopsy performed for an abnormal clinical or radiographic finding such as a palpable tumor or tumors seen on an imaging study. The finding of a dilated, mucin filled appendix on CT scan or MRI should prompt concern for an appendiceal tumor and an appendectomy should be considered. The different types of appendiceal tumors and cancers can be distinguished by the appearance of the cells under the microscope and by staining them for specific markers.

Bacterial Meningitis in general occurs most often during the first month of a newborn’s life and is usually caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or by group B streptococcus.  Bacterial Meningitis caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B occurs most often in infants over 1 month old and young children.  However, in the United States, this type of Bacterial Meningitis occurs more often in adults as a result of a vaccine that has led to a decline in the number of affected infants and children.

Symptoms may include the production of breast milk (lactation) not associated with nursing and the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to the lack of monthly ovulation (anovulation). The symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome include the abnormal production of breast milk (galactorrhea) without childbirth and nursing, and the lack of regular menstrual periods (amenorrhea).  Women with this disorder have breasts and nipples of normal size and appearance.  Secondary female sexual characteristics, such as hair distribution and voice, are also normal.  Since the ovaries do not produce eggs, affected females cannot become pregnant. The exact cause of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome is not known, although some research suggests that small tumors in the pituitary or hypothalamus glands may be responsible for some cases.  These tumors are frequently microscopic and extremely difficult to detect.  Rarer causes of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome may be associated with low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), chronic use of drugs that inhibit dopamine (antagonistics) (e.g., chlorpromazine or thorazine), and discontinuation of oral contraceptives (birth control pills).  In all cases, an over-secretion of the milk-producing hormone prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) results in the symptoms of Ahumada-Del Castillo. Ahumada-Del Castillo affects only females.

It is characterized by abnormal elongation and blackish or dark brownish discoloration or "staining" of the thread-like elevations (filiform papillae) that cover most of the tongue\'s surface (dorsum linguae). Such changes often begin at the back (posterior) region of the top of the tongue and extend toward the front (anterior) of the tongue\'s surface but never involve the undersurface. Hairy tongue is thought to result from failure of the normal “shedding” (desquamation) of the outermost layer of the filiform papillae, overgrowth of certain pigment-producing bacteria or fungi normally present in the mouth, and an abnormal accumulation of pigment residues, keratin, or other debris in the region.  (Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a primary component of the outermost layer of the skin, nails, and hair.)  Although the specific underlying cause of hairy tongue remains unknown, several potential predisposing factors have been implicated.  Such factors include treatment with certain antibiotic medications (e.g., tetracycline therapy, which may lead to overgrowth of certain fungi); the use of particular oral bismuth-containing medications; the use of mouthwashes; smoking; chewing tobacco; excessive alcohol consumption; and/or poor oral hygiene.  Hairy tongue is not infectious nor does it lead to oral cancer. In males or females with hairy tongue, the age of onset is variable.  Hairy tongue most commonly affects adults; however, it may sometimes occur during childhood or adolescence.  It is not an inherited disease. There are additional disorders and conditions that may result in abnormal color changes or other alterations of the tongue.  Such conditions and disorders are typically characterized by symptoms and physical findings that differ from those associated with hairy tongue.  (For further information, choose the specific condition name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) In individuals with suspected hairy tongue, receiving a thorough evaluation by physicians, dentists, and/or oral surgeons is important to exclude other underlying conditions and to confirm a diagnosis of hairy tongue. Recommended treatment measures typically include removing potential predisposing factors, such as stopping smoking, discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible and receiving proper alternative treatments as necessary under a physician\'s direction, and/or other appropriate steps. In addition, affected individuals should speak with their dental specialists for guidance concerning appropriate measures to improve oral hygiene in their particular case. Such measures typically include using a soft-bristled toothbrush to regularly cleanse the tongue.', 'annotations': 'T1\tSIGN 0 8\tErythema\nT2\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 19\tErythema multiforme\nT3\tSKINRAREDISEASE 21 23\tEM\nT4\tDISEASE 59 75\thypersensitivity\nT5\tSIGN 152 181\tsymmetric red, patchy lesions\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 241 243\tEM\nT7\tDISEASE 282 296\therpes simplex\nT8\tSIGN 661 669\tErythema\nT9\tSKINRAREDISEASE 661 680\tErythema multiforme\nT10\tANAPHOR 748 750\tIt\nT11\tSIGN 927 934\tlesions\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tIs_a Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tIs_acron Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T7 Arg2:T60\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tAnaphora Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\n'}, {'text': 'Primary distal renal tubular acidosis affects females and males in equal numbers.

Typical symptoms include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, sucking or fish-like movements of the mouth. In some cases, the arms and/or legs may also be affected by involuntary rapid, jerking movements (chorea), or slow, writhing movements (athetosis). Symptoms of tardive dystonia include slower, twisting movements of larger muscles of the neck and trunk as well as the face. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by long-term use of a class of drugs known as neuroleptics. Neuroleptic drugs are often prescribed for management of certain mental, neurological, or gastrointestinal disorders. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are drugs used for chronic gastrointestinal conditions that may cause tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic drugs block dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is a chemical that helps brain cells to communicate. Although most cases occur after a person has taken these drugs for several years, some cases may occur with shorter use of neuroleptic drugs. Tardive dyskinesia affects individuals who have been taking neuroleptic drugs for a long period of time. A high percentage of schizophrenic people who have spent long periods of time taking these drugs have a high risk of developing TD.

Muscular rigidity often fluctuates (i.e., grows worse and then improves) and usually occurs along with the muscle spasms. Spasms may occur randomly or be triggered by a variety of different events including a sudden noise or light physical contact. In most cases, other neurological signs or symptoms do not occur. The severity and progression of SPS varies from one person to another. If left untreated, SPS can potentially progress to cause difficulty walking and significantly impact a person's ability to perform routine, daily tasks. Although the exact cause of SPS is unknown, it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder and sometimes occurs along with other autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis of SPS is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. Additional tests can be used to support a diagnosis and to rule out other conditions. Such tests include screening tests to detect the presence of antibodies against GAD-65, antibodies against amphiphysin (which are associated with paraneoplastic SPS) and an electromyography (EMG), a test that records electrical activity in skeletal (voluntary) muscles at rest and during muscle contraction. An EMG can demonstrate continuous muscle motor unit firing in stiff muscles, which is characteristic of SPS.

Neurologic symptoms are progressive and usually start in infancy but may even be apparent at birth. These symptoms can include motor delay, poor muscle tone, seizures, incoordination (ataxia), abnormal eye movements and poor visual tracking. Infants with the prenatal onset form may demonstrate brain malformations on neuroimaging. Individuals with the early childhood-onset form of PDCD may have normal neurologic development with intermittent periods of ataxia, often associated with upper respiratory infection or other minor stress. Varying degrees of neurologic deficits and mental retardation may occur in individuals with PDCD. Several hundred cases of PDCD have been reported. More males than females have severe disease and early death and progressive neurological symptoms are observed more often in females, although some females have severe symptoms. Biochemical abnormalities may vary from severe acidosis (due to abnormally high levels of lactic acid) appearing shortly after birth to a mildly elevated level which usually follows a meal high in carbohydrates. In some cases elevation of blood lactate levels is seen only during the acute episodes. Excretion of abnormally large amounts of the amino acid alanine (alaninuria) may occur only during acute episodes.

Behavioral and sleep disturbances, including extreme irritability, inconsolable crying, reduced and fragmented sleep (insomnia) and rage attacks are common. Difficulty articulating speech (dysarthria), sometimes with complete loss of speech and language may occur. Additional symptoms such as decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and vomiting are common. The most common cause of OMS in young children is paraneoplastic. A small, often hidden tumor presumably provokes the immune system into attacking the nervous system, which may also control the tumor or even cause it to regress. Tumors are NOT in the brain, but are in other areas of the body, usually in chest or abdomen. In 50-80 percent of affected young children, a tumor of embryonic nerve cells (neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma) is responsible for the symptoms associated with OMS. In other affected individuals, the disorder has been designated ‘idiopathic’ or attributed to various mostly viral infections. However, the high rate of spontaneous tumor regression means that the tumor may be gone before it is looked for. In older children or teens, viral infections are the most frequent apparent cause of OMS. In adults, paraneoplastic etiology is more common, most due to lung or breast cancers. In contrast to paraneoplastic OMS in infants and young children, whose tumors are biologically inactive and often benign, the tumors in adults are commonly malignant, often disseminated. OMS is a rare disorder: 1 per million individuals worldwide. It usually affects infants and young children, although it is also known to affect adults. The peak age in children is about 18 months, with very few diagnosed before 1 year, and a long tail out to about 5 – 6 years. Occurrence of opsoclonus in infants under 6 months old is quite uncommon, and opsoclonus in that age group, when isolated, is usually from another cause. OMS occurs in only slightly more girls than boys. It occurs in about 3% of all children with neuroblastomas. The diagnosis is clinical; there is no diagnostic test yet, as the antigen remains unidentified. The presence of the ‘dancing eyes’, the shock-like muscle spasms, and the impairment of gait, especially if accompanied by irritability, are highly reliable indicators of this syndrome. To detect a tumor in children, either a CT scan with oral and IV contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis need to be done. PET scanning is often done in adults with OMS looking for other occult tumors. In addition, a spinal tap to detect neuroinflammation is necessary. Besides routine tests for infection, recommended CSF studies include so-called “MS panel”, to include oligoclonal bands (with paired serum sample), looking for antibodies secreted by B cells in the CSF. Also, lymphocyte subset analysis (flow cytometry) using immunophenotyping reveals an increased frequency of CSF CD 19+ B cells, which is an invaluable biomarker of OMS disease activity. Autoantibodies in some children with OMS have been at detected in research laboratories, but commercial autoantibody testing is not cost-effective and best reserved for atypical cases.\n', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 5\tHLRCC\nT2\tANAPHOR 50 62\tThe disorder\nT3\tSIGN 135 150\tuterine fibroid\nT4\tRAREDISEASE 214 219\tHLRCC\nR1\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\n'}, {'text': 'To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known.

Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature.

This disorder may be accompanied with fevers, night sweats, weight loss and dry cough. Dry cough is one distinction from typical pneumonia because spit (sputum) is too thick to become productive, therefore productive cough is not as common in PJP. Uncommonly, the PJP fungus can spread to other body organs such as the liver, kidney and spleen as the disease progresses. PJP is a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States and in Europe. Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly seen in HIV infected people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3. People receiving high doses of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant or to treat cancer are at risk for PJP. People with other inflammatory conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), polymyositis or dermatomyositis can also have an increased risk of acquiring PJP. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia requires multiple tests such as a chest X-ray and a sample of sputum collected by a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage to differentiate PJP between from other causes of pneumonia. To further confirm PJP, a test to amplify trace amounts of DNA (polymerase chain reaction or PCR) is used and a blood test to detect β-D-glucan is used.', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 99 137\tspondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 221 240\tskeletal dysplasias\n'}, {'text': 'Diamond Blackfan anemia affects approximately 5 to 7 people per million live births per year.

The diagnostic criteria are currently based upon the consensus criteria of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee.

Women with this disorder develop normal secondary sexual characteristics during puberty (e.g., breast development and pubic hair), but do not have a menstrual cycle (primary amenorrhea). Often, the failure to begin the menstrual cycle is the initial clinical sign of MRKH syndrome. The range and severity of MRKH syndrome can vary greatly and the disorder is generally broken down into type I, which occurs as an isolated finding, and type II, which occurs with abnormalities of additional organ systems including mainly the kidneys and the skeleton. Because of the nature of the disorder, MRKH syndrome can cause significant psychological challenges and counseling is recommended. The exact cause of MRKH syndrome remains largely unknown, but there is now no doubt of a genetic origin. In this respect, an update on the most recent research publications shows the involvement of several chromosomal segments, some of them including genes likely to account for the disorder.', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 125 149\tmaternal hypopituitarism\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 159 175\tSheehan syndrome\nT3\tRAREDISEASE 177 179\tSS\nT4\tSIGN 267 296\tpituitary cells to be damaged\nT5\tSIGN 267 282;305 313\tpituitary cells necrosis\nT6\tSIGN 326 384\tproduction of the usual pituitary hormones will be reduced\nT7\tSIGN 717 778\tamount of hormones produced by the pituitary may be decreased\nT8\tDISEASE 823 838\thypopituitarism\nT9\tSIGN 823 838\thypopituitarism\nT10\tANAPHOR 872 884\tthe disorder\nT11\tRAREDISEASE 1190 1206\tSheehan syndrome\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 1311 1327\tSheehan syndrome\nT13\tSIGN 1406 1437\tlong-lasting low blood pressure\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tAnaphora Arg1:T2 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tIs_acron Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n'}, {'text': 'UCD and iMCD affect males and females in equal numbers, and there are no known factors that increase the risk of UCD or iMCD.

It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The disorder occurs in both an acute and a chronic intermittent form. In the acute form of Isovaleric Acidemia, vomiting, refusal to eat, and listlessness usually occur. With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaleric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal  recessive genes.  Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme  isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown  of the amino acid leucine.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the disorder. The risk of  transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  On average, fifty percent of their children will be carriers of the disease, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent for that trait.  The risks are the same for each pregnancy.

This disorder is characterized by abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. Pale, tightly curled hair is frequently seen in those affected. Giant axonal neuropathy follows autosomal recessive genetic inheritance. Symptoms of giant axonal neuropathy occur in early childhood before the age of seven years. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are affected. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system spreads out from the brain and spinal cord to all other areas of the body. Characteristics include low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), seizures and intellectual disability. In contrast to purely peripheral neuropathies, the reflex of the toes known as Babinski’s sign is often positive, indicating involvement of central motor pathways. Most affected children have pale, tightly curled hair unlike their parent’s hair. Cranial nerves may also be affected leading to facial weakness, abnormal eyes and poor vision. An unusual leg posture is present in some affected children. Skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and foot deformities have been described and are thought to be a result of the nervous system dysfunction. Mental development is in most cases initially normal, but later in childhood degenerative mental changes (dementia) may occur as the disorder progresses. Giant axonal neuropathy is rapidly progressive, usually leading to dependence on a wheel chair by the second decade of life and death in the second or third decade.

The prevalence of giant axonal neuropathy and the frequency of carriers of one defective copy of the GAN gene is not known, but it is known that giant axonal neuropathy is a very rare disease. Diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy is made by clinical findings and specialized tests including nerve conduction velocity, brain MRI and peripheral nerve biopsy. The hallmark finding on a peripheral nerve biopsy is the appearance of "giant axons" which are caused by the accumulation of neurofilaments.

The hypothalamus regulates sleep cycles and body temperature and composition while stimulating the pituitary gland to release a variety of hormones that control growth, metabolism, and body development. Thus, numerous pituitary gland hormones could be indirectly disrupted by damage to the hypothalamus. Unlike similar diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Froehlich syndrome is acquired, not inherited, and is associated with tumors of the hypothalamus area or their surgical treatment, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. This syndrome affects males more often than females. Froehlich syndrome is characterized by increased or excessive eating that leads to obesity, small testes, and a delay in the onset of puberty. It is also common for children with Froehlich syndrome to experience the delay in physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

Dyskeratosis is Latin and means the irreversible degeneration of skin tissue, and congenita means inborn. First described in the medical literature in 1906, dyskeratosis congenita was originally thought to be a skin disease that also affects the nails and the mouth. Only later in the sixties was it realized that patients with these skin changes almost always develop bone marrow failure. Thus, for the last 40 years or so, the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed when patients presented with the triad of abnormal skin, malformation (dystrophy) of the nails, and white, thickened patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral leukoplakia). The skin changes may be present before the development of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure is usually diagnosed by the low number of circulating blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Additional findings in patients with dyskeratosis congenita may include short stature, eye and tooth abnormalities, thin and early graying of the hair, lung (pulmonary) disease, liver disease, gut abnormalities, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infertility, learning difficulties, and delays in reaching developmental milestones. An increased incidence of leukemia and cancer has also been documented. The prevalence or incidence of dyskeratosis congenita is difficult to assess. In a population of patients with bone marrow failure about 2-5% of patients have bone marrow failure due to dyskeratosis congenita. In patients with pulmonary fibrosis similarly 2-5% are thought to be due to mutations in TERC or TERT. In families with an increased frequency of bone marrow failure and/or lung disease, dyskeratosis congenita should be excluded as a possible cause of their disease.', 'annotations': 'T1\tSKINRAREDISEASE 0 21\tPachydermoperiostosis\nT2\tSIGN 58 81\tclubbing of the fingers\nT3\tSIGN 119 129\tpachyderma\nT4\tSIGN 156 169\thyperhidrosis\nT5\tANAPHOR 172 174\tIt\nT6\tSKINRAREDISEASE 303 324\tPachydermoperiostosis\nT7\tSIGN 529 540\tperiostosis\nT8\tSKINRAREDISEASE 646 649\tHOA\nT9\tSIGN 679 695\tdigital clubbing\nT10\tSIGN 722 733\tperiostosis\nT11\tSKINRAREDISEASE 736 757\tPachydermoperiostosis\nT12\tSKINRAREDISEASE 782 785\tHOA\nT13\tSIGN 826 834\tclubbing\nT14\tSIGN 842 853\tperiostosis\nT15\tSIGN 876 886\tpachyderma\nR1\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tAnaphora Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tProduces Arg1:T6 Arg2:T100\t\nR8\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\n'}, {'text': 'Timothy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the heart and several other organs.

Skeletal malformations in the legs may cause problems walking and may eventually result in short stature. Additional symptoms include pain, fractures of affected bones, and muscle weakness. Because the biochemical and radiographic findings of hereditary hyperphosphatasia are similar to those of Paget's disease (a focal skeletal disorder of adults characterized by abnormal bone turnover), the disorder is sometimes referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. However, despite these similarities, the two disorders are distinct. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Hereditary hyperphosphatasia affects males and females in equal numbers. Like all recessive disorders it is more common in countries where within-family marriage is practiced. More than 50 cases have been described since the disorder was first reported in the medical literature in 1956.

The cerebellum is the area of the brain that helps coordinate movement, and is also involved with cognition and behavior. The 4th ventricle is a space around the cerebellum that channels fluid from inside to around the outside of the brain. DWM is characterized by underdevelopment (small size and abnormal position) of the middle part of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle and enlargement of the base of the skull (posterior fossa). DWM is sometimes (20-80%) associated with hydrocephalus, in which blockage of the normal flow of spinal fluid leads to excessive amounts of fluid accumulating in and around the brain. This leads to abnormally high pressure within the skull and swelling of the head, and can lead to neurological impairment. DWM results from defects in early embryonic development of the cerebellum and surrounding structures.  A few patients have chromosome abnormalities including deletion of chromosome 3q24.3 (the location of the first DWM genes, known as ZIC1 and ZIC4), 6p25 or 13q32.2-q33.2, or duplication of 9p.  In the remainder, it is probably due to other more complex genetic and perhaps environmental factors (teratogens) as the recurrence risk in siblings less than 5%.  A few examples of affected siblings with isolated Dandy-Walker malformation have been reported, suggesting autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, but most of these are probably CVH and not typical DWM.  In these families, the recurrence risk is higher, up to 25%.  DWM may also occur as part of a genetic syndrome that includes multiple birth defects, such as the PHACES syndrome of facial hemangioma, heart and sternal defects and DWM.  Many other syndromes and chromosome abnormalities have been reported with DWM, but most of these appear to have CVH rather than typical DWM.

In rare cases, macroglossia occurs as an isolated finding that is present at birth (congenital). In many cases, macroglossia may occur secondary to a primary disorder that may be either congenital (e.g., Down syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) or acquired (e.g., as a result of trauma or malignancy). Symptoms and physical findings associated with macroglossia may include noisy, high-pitched breathing (stridor), snoring, and/or feeding difficulties. In some cases, the tongue may protrude from the mouth. When inherited, macroglossia is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Macroglossia is a disorder characterized by a tongue that is large in proportion to other structures in the mouth.  In the congenital type of the disorder, protrusion of the tongue from the mouth may interfere with feeding of the infant.  Later, talking may be affected.  The large size of the tongue may also cause abnormal development of the jaw and teeth, resulting in misaligned or protruding teeth.  Ulceration and dying tissue on the tip of the tongue may be other symptoms of the disorder. Isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia is very rare, with about 50 cases reported in the medical literature.  The prevalence in other instances depends on the underlying disorder for which the macroglossia is secondary.  For example, macroglossia occurs in most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the prevalence of that syndrome is estimated at 1 in 17,000 births. Infants born with isolated autosomal dominant macroglossia present with the obvious sign at birth.

It typically appears during childhood or adolescence, often around the time of puberty, and progresses slowly for about ten years. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females with a ratio of 7:1.  This ratio may not be totally valid since females often have milder symptoms than do men, with the fibrous bone growth (periostosis) not being detected unless X-rays are taken. Diagnosis is made clinically. Major diagnostic criteria for HOA are clubbing of the fingers (digital clubbing) and fibrous bone growth (periostosis). Pachydermoperiostosis is the complete form of HOA.

The disorder is typically characterized by short stature, variable degrees of mental retardation, speech delays, malformations of the skull and facial (craniofacial) region, and/or additional physical abnormalities. Associated craniofacial defects may vary greatly in range and severity from case to case. However, such features commonly include an unusually small head (microcephaly); a broad, flat nose; a "carp-shaped" mouth; large, protruding ears; widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism); and/or other abnormalities. Rarely (i.e., in about 10 percent of cases), Monosomy 18p may be associated with holoprosencephaly, a condition in which the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide properly during embryonic development. Holoprosencephaly may result in varying degrees of mental retardation, other neurologic findings, and/or extremely variable midline facial defects, such as the presence of a single, central front tooth (maxillary incisor); closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism); an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate); and/or, in severe cases, absence of the nose and/or cyclopia. Cyclopia is characterized by fusion of the eye cavities (orbits) into a single cavity containing one eye.

In classic bladder exstrophy, most anomalies are related to defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitalia, pelvic bones, rectum and anus. In normal development, the cloacal membrane temporarily separates the urogenital and anal structures and them breaks when tissue that will form abdominal muscles begins to grow in its place.   The bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex is caused by a developmental abnormality that occurs 4-5 weeks after conception in which the cloacal membrane is not replaced by tissue that will form the abdominal muscles.  The underlying cause of this error in development is not known. The birth prevalence of classic bladder exstrophy has been estimated to be between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 livebirths.

Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSD VII) is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise.  GSD VII is caused by abnormalities in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene that results in a deficiency of the phosphofructokinase enzyme. This enzyme deficiency leads to a reduced amount of energy available to muscles during exercise.  GSD VII is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSD type VII usually begins in childhood and is characterized by weakness, pain and stiffness during exercise, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting and dark, burgundy-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin (myoglobinuria).  Destruction of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) can also occur.  A rare form of GSD type VII has been reported in infants that is associated with progressive loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness and death.  A late-onset form has been reported in adults who experience only muscle weakness. Glycogen storage disease type VII is a rare disorder that occurs more often in individuals of Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  GSD type VII affects males and females in equal numbers. GSD type VII is diagnosed by a muscle biopsy for measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level or measurement of the phosphofructokinase enzyme level in red blood cells.

They are non-progressive lesions and do not expand, spread or metastasize to other locations. They grow in proportion to normal brain growth, and consequently their relative size to the rest of the brain is the same for the lifetime of the patient. There is tremendous diversity in the type and severity of symptoms from patient to patient. However, symptoms are apparent during childhood in the overwhelming majority of patients. Two clinical phenotypes of HH are recognized: 1) central precocious puberty and 2) epilepsy and related neurobehavioral symptoms. Hypothalamic hamartomas are relatively rare. Population-based research has shown that HH with epilepsy occurs in 1 of 200,000 children and adolescents. The prevalence of HH with only precocious puberty is unknown. At least for HH with epilepsy, males appear to have a slightly higher risk than females (approximately 1.3 to 1 ratio). HH occurs worldwide, without any obvious geographical concentration of cases. It is currently felt that all ethnic groups are at equal risk. There are no identified maternal risk factors or fetal exposures that increase the risk of HH. As malformations of the ventral (inferior) hypothalamus, hypothalamic hamartomas are rather distinct from other conditions. It is important to note that tumors that occur in the same region (such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, etc) usually do not cause gelastic seizures. These tumors can, however, be associated with endocrine dysfunction, which includes precocious puberty under rare circumstances.', 'annotations': 'T1\tRAREDISEASE 0 18\tFroehlich syndrome\nT2\tRAREDISEASE 34 58\tadiposogenital dystrophy\nT3\tDISEASE 82 105\tendocrine abnormalities\nT4\tSIGN 130 156\tdamage to the hypothalamus\nT5\tSIGN 534 560\tdamage to the hypothalamus\nT6\tRAREDISEASE 594 615\tPrader-Willi syndrome\nT7\tRAREDISEASE 617 635\tFroehlich syndrome\nT8\tDISEASE 687 713\ttumors of the hypothalamus\nT9\tSYMPTOM 756 774\tincreased appetite\nT10\tSIGN 779 814\tdepressed secretion of gonadotropin\nT11\tANAPHOR 816 829\tThis syndrome\nT12\tRAREDISEASE 869 887\tFroehlich syndrome\nT13\tSIGN 908 937\tincreased or excessive eating\nT14\tDISEASE 952 959\tobesity\nT15\tSIGN 952 959\tobesity\nT16\tSIGN 961 973\tsmall testes\nT17\tSIGN 981 1010\tdelay in the onset of puberty\nT18\tRAREDISEASE 1048 1066\tFroehlich syndrome\nT19\tSIGN 1085 1109\tdelay in physical growth\nT20\tSIGN 1085 1093;1118 1165\tdelay in development of secondary sexual characteristics\nT21\tANAPHOR 1224 1237\tthis syndrome\nT22\tRAREDISEASE 1315 1333\tFroehlich syndrome\nT23\tSIGN 1351 1376\tintellectual difficulties\nT24\tSIGN 1378 1389\tpoor vision\nT25\tSIGN 1396 1414\toptic nerve damage\nT26\tSIGN 1417 1427\tsomnolence\nT27\tDISEASE 1433 1451\tdiabetes insipidus\nT28\tSIGN 1433 1451\tdiabetes insipidus\nT29\tRAREDISEASE 1464 1492\tInfundibulo-tuberal syndrome\nT30\tRAREDISEASE 1494 1533\tFroehlich+somnolence+diabetes insipidus\nT31\tSIGN 1572 1583\thypothermia\nT32\tSIGN 1589 1607\tvery delicate skin\nT33\tRAREDISEASE 1609 1627\tFroehlich syndrome\nR1\tIs_a Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tProduces Arg1:T1 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tIs_synon Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR7\tIncreases_risk_of Arg1:T8 Arg2:T1\t\nR8\tAnaphora Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T150\t\nR11\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tProduces Arg1:T12 Arg2:T17\t\nR13\tProduces Arg1:T18 Arg2:T19\t\nR14\tProduces Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR15\tAnaphora Arg1:T18 Arg2:T21\t\nR16\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T230\t\nR17\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T24\t\nR18\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T25\t\nR19\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T26\t\nR20\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T28\t\nR21\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T31\t\nR22\tProduces Arg1:T22 Arg2:T320\t\nR23\tProduces Arg1:T30 Arg2:T28\t\nR24\tIs_synon Arg1:T30 Arg2:T29\t\n'}, {'text': 'The prevalence of porphyria remains unknown, but clinicians suggest that a range of 1 per 500-50,000 of population is probable.

The immune system is the body’s natural defense system against foreign or invading organisms or substances. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the immune system responds to a stimulus or ‘trigger’, often an infection, but the response is ineffective and abnormal. This ineffective, abnormal response, causes a variety of signs and symptoms, which, if not treated, can potentially become life-threatening. Some affected individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This is known as the primary or familial form. In other individuals, the disorder occurs sporadically usually when there is an underlying predisposing condition or disorder. This is known as the secondary form. The secondary forms are more common than the familial forms. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants from birth to 18 months, but can affect individuals of any age. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis most often affects infants or young children, but can affect individuals of any age. It affects boys and girls in equal numbers. In adults, it affects men slightly more often than women. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown.

Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis).

In most cases, symptoms begin with one eye first, followed a few weeks later by visual failure in the other eye. Extremely rarely there may be neurologic abnormalities, such as peripheral neuropathy, postural tremor, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA and it is transmitted by maternal inheritance. LHON affects approximately 1:50,000 people. Many carriers never suffer significant visual loss; males are about four to five times more likely than females to be affected. LHON affects both males and females and can only be inherited from a female. The birth prevalence of LHON is approximately 1 in 50,000 people. LHON is diagnosed based on ophthalmologic findings, which include specialized visual testing. The testing involves dilated fundus examination to identify characteristic changes in the optic disc and vascular changes during the acute phase, electrophysiologic studies, and neuroimaging. Molecular genetic testing for mitochondrial genes associated with LHON can be used to confirm diagnosis.
