- Prompt to generate the test set:

You are a helpful assistant. Please generate a list of medical symptoms along with the disease they are most commonly associated with. The format should be:
1. **User Input** (A description of the symptoms in a natural conversational style, as if the patient is describing them to a doctor.)
2. **Disease** (The disease or condition most likely associated with those symptoms.)

Example:
1. "I have a persistent cough and a fever for the past few days." 
   **Disease:** COVID-19

Please provide 100 pairs unique of **user_input** and **disease** following this format and format the output in a CSV format with two columns: 
1. the first column is the symptom description (user_input), and 
2. the second column is the associated disease.. Use a variety of diseases and symptoms, and ensure that the descriptions are medically accurate and reflect common conditions.
